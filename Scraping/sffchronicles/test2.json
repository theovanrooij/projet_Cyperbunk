Cyberpunk is about an   technologically   advanced   dystopian future.  Steampunk is  about an alternative history.

The majority of the episode involves the planning and execution of a heist, and everyone has a part to play (except Inara, who is away, and Book, who doesn't appear at all). We get a glimpse of life in the core worlds, which looks like a cross between the Star Trek Federation, one of the cleaner cyberpunk futures, and Milton Keynes. There are some good twists and turns and we get a first glimpse of the blue-handed secret service agents of the Alliance and their strange weaponry.
