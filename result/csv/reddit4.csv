Socrates explains how the philosopher is like a prisoner who is freed from the cave and comes to understand that the shadows on the wall are not reality at all, for he can perceive the true form of reality rather than the manufactured reality that is the shadows seen by the prisoners. The inmates of this place do not even desire to leave their prison, for they know no better life. The prisoners manage to break their bonds one day, and discover that their reality was not what they thought it was. They discovered the sun, which Plato uses as an analogy for the fire that man cannot see behind. Like the fire that cast light on the walls of the cave, the human condition is forever bound to the impressions that are received through the senses. Even if these interpretations (or, in Kantian terminology, intuitions) are an absurd misrepresentation of reality, we cannot somehow break free from the bonds of our human condition - we cannot free ourselves from phenomenal state just as the prisoners could not free themselves from their chains. If, however, we were to miraculously escape our bondage, we would find a world that we could not understand - the sun is incomprehensible for someone who has never seen it.

Cyberpunk to me is the playing out of a number of themes within a specific setting. (1) The setting\xa0of cyberpunk is a near-future (""20 minutes in the future""\xa0as both\xa0Max Headroom\xa0and Terry Gilliam\'s\xa0Brazil\xa0explicitly situate themselves) which is characterized by increasing human population, urbanization, straining of scarce resources, environmental degradation, marked income inequality, near-ubiquity of high-tech devices. (2) The themes\xa0typically explored in cyberpunk are: (a) Conspiracy theories, increasing access to overwhelming amounts of often trivial, self-contradicting, or disorienting information (often used as a means to investigate the nature of knowledge/epistemology, see:\xa0Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Libertyby H. Kojima,\xa0Johnny Mnemonic\xa0by W. Gibson,\xa012 Monkeys\xa0by T. Gilliam - also often used as a means to convey a growing sense of cultural\xa0ennui\xa0or nihilism, especially w/', ' an increasingly postmodern culture and world) (b) Social Engineering (c) Artificial intelligence (often used as a means to investigate the nature of being/ontology, see:\xa0Ghost in the Shell\xa0by M. Shirow,\xa0Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\xa0P.K. Dick,\xa0I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream\xa0by H. Ellison,\xa0Memoirs Found in a Bathtub\xa0by S. Lem, and\xa0Creatures of Light and Darkness\xa0by R. Zelazny) (d) Memes and censorship (e) Blurring of the line b/w humans and their creations - this is usually explored through the presence of cyborgs, humans with augmented components, or even non-cyborg humans who have developed psychological dependencies to their computers or gadgets (see: Case in\xa0Neuromancer\xa0by W. Gibson - additionally, this theme has often been manifested as a mode of investigating changing gender dynamics and identity through the use of characters who have in some fundamental way altered their humanity through body modification or DNA manipulation, see: ""Transient movement"" in\xa0Transmetropolitan\xa0by W. Ellis) Now, I\'m by no means a cyberpunk purist, meaning that I accept that there might be such a thing as ""cyberpunk music"" and ""cyberpunk fashion"", etc. etc. even though they may not intrinsically recall a specific setting or employ thematic devices (""goth ninja"" [lol] in and itself cannot be cyberpunk by strict definitions, but whatever I don\'t give a fuck). So how do I account for the fact that we associate certain kinds of electronic music and certain kinds of clothing and certain kinds of sketchy neo-futuristic downtown settings with cyberpunk? Well, in my opinion it\'s because there is a\xa0tendency\xa0for the above themes being played out in the above setting to be manifested in a specific way. What does that mean? Well, greater income inequality means larger and more depressing slums, but at the same time the ubiquity of technology makes that slum the neon-and-computer-screen-lit slum that we think of. The notable income inequality (Virek in\xa0Count Zero\xa0by W. Gibson is said to possess such a great wealth that even he is unable to relate to it in real terms, similarly the Tessier-Ashpool family in\xa0Neuromancer\xa0also by W. Gibson is absurdly rich as well) found in cyberpunk means that the horizon of the neon-lit slum is made up of super-skyscrapers and arcologies (see the L.A. skyline in\xa0Blade Runner\xa0by R. Scott). The slums and cities will be densely populated as well because of increasing human population and urbanization - moreover, these cities will most likely have the smog and darkness that we typically associate with cyberpunk because of the environmental degradation that we are now experiencing and which will likely get worse in the next few years. Hmm, so when you put all the themes I listed above within the specific setting of cyberpunk you arrive at a rather stereotypical image of what cyberpunk is: stories taking place in a bleak, unfriendly future where life is lived day-to-night on cocktails of drugs, brushing past faceless crowds and threading your way through neon-through-smog-lit streets filled with the din of merchants selling used ono sendai decks and untraceable handguns. Now, some purists might say that this image of cyberpunk (the one we all have in our mind\'s eye when we recall the genre) is too constraining and is nothing more than\xa0cliche. My rebuttal is simply that there is a\xa0tendency\xa0towards this expression of cyberpunk, because of the themes and setting of the genre.

They do not exist... When men work together with other men as a team pushing through adversity to complete a task they relish in the bond of camaraderie together. Men have honor. In that moment they truly respect one another. They shake each others hand and are proud of the task they accomplish TOGETHER and they enjoyed doing with their brethren. It’s not about themselves. Women tend to hate one another. They have no idea what camaraderie tastes like because they never let go of their deep seated vile hatred and distrust and resentment of one another. I have seen them only work together when required and even then the fake facades the raise are seen to quickly be abandoned as they become harshly combative and accusatory of their fellow women over seemingly trivial matters and they will gossip about each other behind their backs. It is as though they forcefully keep an emotional buffer up between one another as to not get to close or genuinely open up to one another. It is quite astounding. When women are pushed to work as a group through adverse that force them get close to their companions, where men would earn each others respect and bond together, women instead become vile and viscous to each other and all whom cross their path. They become increasingly viscous with each subsequent attempt at rational discourse and will say increasingly hurtful things and disrespect all that is sacrosanct just to insure they have the last word. I swear I have witnessed this many times and have tried to reason and even explain to the women the astounding level of callous disrespect they are exhibiting and they sling increasingly hurtful and infantile retorts as though I have challenged them to some sort of war-of-insults.

The dialogue, especially in the first episode, is so astonishingly lame I kept thinking it was trying to be a parody of itself and a lot of the episodes left me totally unsatisfied while the rest weren't handled as well as they could have been. Even the one or two decent ideas are let down by lazy writing (entire stories told in voiceover is the worst possible way to adapt a story to screen). I only watched them all out of a perverse fascination in a series that obviously had a solid budget, but no vision or desire to take risks. Sonnie's Edge is the closest it ever comes to taking risks, and that's only because it was so generic and predictable that it was almost as offensive as a rape revenge narrative (offensive enough as it is for being so dull) that only ever shows explicit violence towards women (the one redeeming feature of those narratives is the catharsis at the end where the protagonist unleashes the hell they went through on the perpetrator - which they inexplicably deny after making you watch someone's head being smashed in, and the guy who's about to be killed before it cuts to credits isn't even one of the perpetrators, I mean goddamn. What the hell was the thought process there?). It feels like a series of student projects, not stories those involved were excited to tell, but rather a checklist of requirements.

If your aspiration is to be a lone individual in the shadows fighting against the oppressive might of a corrupt sociopolitical order by any means available to you, without yourself becoming a villain, that's a great lesson to take from cyberpunk.  Mike is absolutely correct that the genre as a whole is a warning about the world we face becoming crystallized reality, though -- an observation William Gibson made at a book signing in Austin early this year, too; that he wrote about the grim portents he saw for the future, and people came away with it excited by the possibilities of incautiously developing the very technologies he portrayed as being the machinery of dystopia when used irresponsibly.  William mentioned looking around and seeing the corporate tech giants of our world becoming the very megacorp villains of the genre, and seeing the consumers of that genre inspired by its technology to create those corporations without realizing they were building that dystopian future."", 'When you hear someone say that it\'s better to have targeted ads than privacy, you\'re seeing the basis of the onrushing dystopia.

135,An artificial womb used to help premature lambs fully develop after birth.

However, the development of an ‘artificial placenta’ has been the subject of investigation for over 50 years, with only limited success. The primary obstacles have been progressive circulatory failure due to preload or afterload imbalance imposed on the fetal heart by oxygenator resistance and pump-supported circuits, the use of open fluid incubators resulting in contamination and fetal sepsis and problems related to umbilical vascular access resulting in vascular spasm. To address these obstacles we have designed a system consisting of three main components, specifically, a pumpless arteriovenous circuit, a closed fluid environment with continuous fluid exchange and a new technique of umbilical vascular access. Here we demonstrate that extreme premature fetal lambs can be consistently supported in an extracorporeal device for up to 4 weeks without apparent physiologic derangement or organ failure. These results are superior to all previous attempts at extracorporeal support of the extreme premature fetus in both duration and physiologic well-being.', '::EDIT2:: After reading through the paper, the bag itself is also a significant factor in the success of the experiment.', 'Where can I see this synthetic placenta,?', 'Thank you for the edit.

The lower bands are less suitable because the required antenna would be too big. GPS signals sit around ~1500MHz.
