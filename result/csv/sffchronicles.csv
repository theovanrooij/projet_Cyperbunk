I personally check the concept art first before I watch episode and even if some scenes are revealing, they don't reveal enough and in my mind, I imagine different things than what we'll see in the episodes. I've always been like that, even in the art exhibits. And in my mind when I see Mr Fett standing next to Slave-1 (don't hate me for using the original name) I always conjure him chasing bounties across the galaxy. ",8719,2022

9,What did you blog about today?,Dave,2022-02-21,SFF Lounge,"I know little about American culture relating to this, and I see sci-fi as an American term, but from a British perspective, I do know that for anyone growing up in England in the '50's, '60's and 70's, anyone who liked reading science fiction was thought of as weird, a geek, and a nerd. I know of only two boys who read Marvel ""comic books"" at school and they were both shunned in the same way that train spotters still are today. I worked in Public Libraries in holidays in the 1980's and the science fiction shelves were still, even then, considered not to be very literary. We did read some at school but it was considered childish and something you would grow out of later. There was very little science fiction on TV.

I didn't look long for Heinlein's To Die For, couldn't find it, title is thoughtful. I did find his collection of short stories The Past Through Tomorrow. The wiki blurb, which I didn't see elsewhere, pretty well describes the literary path I am traveling on, parts of a larger storyline about the future rapid collapse of sanity in the United States. I can see the fine line between discouraging readers and hitting the nail on the head when reading the reviews of the story collection, almost all of them are overwhelmingly positive in a positive sense of the meaning. For me, The Past Through Tomorrow coupled with the collapse of sudden sanity, that's turns it into a funeral march title that says to me, not going forward into a better tomorrow, but going backwards in time, repeating past mistakes.
