There are body modifications, designer drugs, and a lot of emphasis on the biostructure of materials. Is it me, or somehow does cyberpunk have a lot of similarities with biopunk?","The fact that it\u2019s bio tech vs silicon tech is virtually  immaterial. Themes are what matters and, in most cases, bio punk is a distinction not worth thinking about unless someone is using it to describe the flavor of an anthology or a similar goal. The exploration of our relationships with one another and with any technology and how that shapes out in a stratified society where there\u2019s a very small set of winners and a lot of losers rife with the consequences of greed and exploitation is what matters when defining cyberpunk.","Cases where the distinction may be worth thinking about are when the story is examining very specific consequences of biotech. Neuromancer is just using this tech as part of a larger landscape  of tech. It\u2019s also not heavily focused on genetech, so probably doesn\u2019t qualify as biopunk just on those grounds.","Tl;dr: I think Neuromancer is straight cyberpunk.","I'm reading it for the first time, haven't got very far yet because my brain fog slows me down a bit.","I'd imagine biopunk is a bit more specific than just bodymods and technology. From what I've seen, it uses literal blood, organs and stuff to power machines. It's a bit more radical than just drugs and VR.","Ofc cyberpunk has similarities with biopunk, pretty obvious don't you think?","Biopunk (as well as nanopunk) isn't separate from cyberpunk, like the colors green and red. It's more like tones of orange, tones of beige and tones of brown. Or maybe a rectangle and square analogy could fit too.","Older cyberpunk often had biological enhancements. Cyberpunk may have no commentary on dna etc., but most that I know if has.","In the 90s there started to appear books about the topic of biological enhancements and dna manipulation, and only about that (without much digital imagery). These works had the \"bio-\" of cyberpunk, but completely lacked the digital tech. It makes sense to call that biopunk.","But if it has biological enhancements, nanobots and also elements of cyberpunk - then just call it cyberpunk.

Imagine what your body does when you get a piece of glass stuck in your foot, except it's trapped in your brain under your skull. Even if there isn't significant trauma from attempted ejection, the sites around the wires & connections harden and stop being a place where you can read signals from.

I personally can't really make a choice. On one hand, hurting animals is heinous, but on the other, there aren't really other options, are there? What do you guys think?","There's a concept in research that uses animals called the three R's, which stands for \"reduce, refine, replace\".  The idea is that you should always try to use \"lower\" organisms when possible, or tissue culture or models.  (Note that I'm not fond of the term \"lower organism\", but it gets the point across.  A non human primate probably is able to contemplate its condition more than a fruit fly, and has a comparatively complex inner life.  As a result, we theorize that they probably would suffer more than a fruit fly if used in the same experiment, for example.).","The next principle, reduce, just means to use as few animals as you can.  We've used a lot of our previous animal research to inform computer simulations, and other systems like the \"brain on a chip\" (basically growing parts of the human brain on cool, complicated in vitro platforms).  That allows us to test a lot of stuff out before we even get to animal testing, which reduces the number of animals we need to use.","\"Refinement\" is one of the important steps these \"researchers\" obviously skipped.  It's really important to practice your techniques and do your best to use sterile techniques, limit pain and suffering, etc.  Researchers do this by practicing techniques on animals that have been euthanized or sacrificed in unrelated experiments to make damn sure they know what they're doing before they operate on a live animal, for example.  And in all operations, they're supposed to make damn sure that the environments are sterile.","Not saying that there aren't researchers out there who don't care about animal welfare (I've met many of them, and they tend to suck in general), but the majority I know do care.  I think our tissue culture and simulations are getting better and better, and I'm hopeful that I'll see a day when we can almost entirely eliminate animal testing.  On a practical note, it's messy, expensive, and depressing, even when you're just working with mice.  But at the moment, there's unfortunately not a great substitute for many experiments.","Testing on animals is unfortunately required for lots of R&D, especially this kind of thing. I don't think anyone would seriously argue against it in general.","There are still gradations of care and safety for the animals that can and should be discussed. Corps will ALWAYS cut as many corners as possible to save a nickel. If it's legal to let horrible things happen to some animals, and expensive to prevent, then it will happen.","We can support both animal testing for our sake and animal welfare for their sake.","The heinous thing about this is that they clearly weren\u2019t even ready to go into this phase of testing. You would have thought the first time they failed they, the procedure would have changed. Nope, it took 23 monkeys to realise that they suck at surgery. Not a problem with the chips.","Ideally, animal testing can be limited in most cases because we can do tests on tissue samples, though in this case it\u2019s not possible.","We do brain surgery on humans all the time. All of the infections could be avoided by at the bare minimum making a sterile operating field, which didn\u2019t happen.","Those monkeys didn\u2019t just die horribly, they died in vain.","It seems like most of the problems are due to infections but not the chips themselves. The method of implantation needs to be more sterile.","They test on animals.  Something people don\u2019t like to think about but it is in every city and surprisingly prevalent.","Better than testing on humans. They usually try to keep animal testing hush hush cause PETA and most people don\u2019t have the stomach to know where your medications and stuff come from.","I\u2019m somewhat an insider, a contractor and man they are strict about info\/ photo leaks at animal testing labs","Whatever you want to say about the ethics of it, this news certainly does not enhance my desire to purchase the future technology","There are still certain ethical guidelines around animal testing, at least in the academic\/medical field. Don't know about private companies though honestly, but since they were working with a university, they still have to uphold these standards. The rate of death for this test does not bode well, whatever the cause is.","Elon has really shown his cards since last time I heard news about Neuralink. even if trials went off exceedingly well, I would never trust putting anything made by that jackass into my brain.","What a surprise said nobody ever","I have a Deep Brain Stimulator device implanted in my head to control my seizures.

These neuralink chips should need a trained neurosurgeon to implant them - obviously if you have randos trying to do the job you're gonna get infections and brain haemorrhages and what seems to be raised intracranial pressure (vomiting)","They literally do have neurosurgeons on the team, even a high precision surgical machine. But still, don\u2019t think the brain is able to handle a physical device in its current state, maybe bloodstream approach is not bad after all?","Idk how any ethics board greenlit this. In Europe this would have never happened.","Don't need an ethics board if you're not trying to publish in academic journals and you're not in a licensed profession.","If you haven't heard an Enterprising Man by Joe Frank it's worth the hour listen.

Humans have been using animals for testing since before we had black and white cameras. Scientists would much rather sacrifice an ape over a human in the name of literally creating a living cyborg. \"WHY do we need cyborgs?\" one might ask, I would reply read you some classic sci-fi and tell me why we DONT need cyborgs. No matter how upset you are, the Argus ii works, blind people can have their vision restored, you're already a cyborg by using a smartphone, and I think the potential for Neural Link is still unrealized or even conceived.","Disgusting.

They will feed and breed until the environment no longer supports their number and some of them die off which causes their population to scale back to the number their habitat can maintain. The ecological balance of harsh reality imposed by limited resources checks a species growth, they do not and will not check themselves.","In our current state of technological advancement we are unique in our power to reshape our environment and evade natural limitations, but that also places us beyond the ability of nature to keep us in check. We can and will destroy our own biosphere to our extreme detriment if we don't make the conscious decision to check ourselves. If we go down that path to self-destruction, we'll take a hell of a lot of other species down with us.

All of a sudden there was no more oil, no more gas, no petrol, no fuel. There were several long hard years as humans shifted fully over to alternative energy.  Nuclear and other alternative energy sources had to be fully relied upon for all of humanity's needs. Solar energy had long since been abandoned as the smog from the machines filled the air and blocked out the sun. Layers of filth and smoke filled the air of Earth, from centuries of diesel and petrol machines. Even after the fossil fuels were gone, the poisoned air remained. And although there was no longer smog and smoke being pumped into the air by the petrol machines, the alternative energy solutions added more problems of their own. The problem of nuclear waste had never been fully solved and now that Nuclear energy was the primary energy of the world, the waste was piling up.","At first the waste was disposed of as safely as possible, but space was limited. Sood, waste was dumped into caves and swamps, as far from humanity as they could. But as time went on, the waste grew and grew. Gasoline had poisoned the air and nuclear waste poisoned the ground and water. Soon, humanity began wearing protective suits as their unprotected members began to die in the poisoned lands.","Cities became the only livable places on Earth left for humans, those who did not concentrate there were slowly poisoned by the air and land. Humanity began to build their cities higher in the air to avoid the ground. Raised trains connected buildings that were too far to be connected by bridges.
