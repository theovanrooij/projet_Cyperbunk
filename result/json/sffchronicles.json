Cyberpunk is about an   technologically   advanced   dystopian future.  Steampunk is  about an alternative history.  The present has developed a different less advanced technology and the stories  more optimistic and adventurous than cyberpunk. It is great that some seem  be so encouraging and positive about writing such a project .I personally would be really  interested in their suggestions on how it could be  done.","message":162,"Year":2022},{"title":"Why do people say things like this?

The majority of the episode involves the planning and execution of a heist, and everyone has a part to play (except Inara, who is away, and Book, who doesn't appear at all). We get a glimpse of life in the core worlds, which looks like a cross between the Star Trek Federation, one of the cleaner cyberpunk futures, and Milton Keynes. There are some good twists and turns and we get a first glimpse of the blue-handed secret service agents of the Alliance and their strange weaponry. While it doesn't have the thoughtfulness of \"Janestown\", it is well-plotted and very entertaining, and widens the Firefly world.","message":6287,"Year":2022},{"title":"Why do people say things like this?

But it does those things while offering some really original SF concepts, convincing visuals, real character jeopardy and great action. I think this kind of satirical presentation is more like Brazil and other Terry Gilliam films in having a core seriousness despite the packaging - which often can be more emotionally impactful than a straight drama. If you removed all the humor from Fifth Element, it would still be a convincing ","message":479,"Year":2022},{"title":"Why do people say things like this?
