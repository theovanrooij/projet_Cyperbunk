What were yours?From Goodreads, I read 70 books this year (the same as last year) and interestingly my average rating was 3.3 - which has been the same for the last 4 years! Weird but it does show a consistent spread!Anyway, my 5-star ratings (across SF&F) were:Dune by Frank Herbert: A re-read that was a long time coming, and it was as good as what I remembered back in the 90's. The research and background of the ecology alone was impressive, especially given it was written in 1965 - it doesn't feel dated at all. I know some people knock Herbert's writing, but personally I don't find it an issue.The Emperor's Soul by Brandon Sanderson: A short novel that really was a consummate display of writing - it had me hooked from the beginning to the end.Beyond Redemption by Michael Fletcher: I read this after seeing it at the top of a Grimdark poll and it didn't disappoint! A fantastic array of imaginative characters and breath of fresh (or maybe fetid?!) air in the fantasy genre.The Rise and Fall of D.O.D.O. by Neal Stephenson and Nicole Galland: A time travel novel full of ideas meshed together into a fun, roller coaster ride, with some great characters to boot. This is the first Stephenson novel I've finished and I feel maybe the co-author has helped make it a more approachable story!I had plenty of 4 star books; some honourable mentions have to be:Osama by Lavie Tidhar: an alternate-reality novel in which Joe, a private detective, is hired to hunt down the mysterious author of pulp fictions books, featuring the vigilante Osama bin Laden. A very thought-provoking, original novel, and World Fantasy Award winner in 2012.The Core of the Sun by  Johanna Sinisalo: an usual alternate history novel that also delves into chilli addiction and the science behind it, whilst being a satire on social issues - strange and original.Also Godsgrave,  Agents of Dreamland, Borne and Kings of the Wyld, mentioned in the 2017 publication thread.Other 4 (or 3.5 star, rounded up) books:Akata Warrior (Akata Witch, #2) - Okorafor, NnediArm of the Sphinx (The Books of Babel, #2) - Bancroft, JosiahArtemis - Weir, AndyCentral Station - Tidhar, LavieGlimpses - Shiner, LewisHappy Endings: A Short Story Collection - Elliott, WillHome (Binti, #2) - Okorafor, NnediMachine Learning: New and Collected Stories - Howey, HughNeverwhere - Gaiman, NeilPolaris - Brown, TimothySea of Rust - Cargill, C.

A Long Time Before NowWilson, Kai Ashante The Sorcerer of the WildeepsWooding, Chris Retribution FallsAlthough there were many fine reads in there, as I mentioned in another thread I only gave one 5-star rating this year -- to The Library at Mount Char. I can't properly express how much I enjoyed that book, which was wild and crazy and disturbing and exhilirating and fun and tragic and thoughtful. Honorable mentions (full reviews can be found on GR under my user name, Contrarius):Perdido Street Station -- I reserve the right to raise this one to 5 stars at a later date. Loved the weirdness, loved the chutzpa, enjoyed the imperfect hero.The Dying Earth -- I only rated this one at 3 stars, but it's a sneaky bugger. Will probably have to reread, likely in actual eyes-on-the-page rather than audio.A Game of Thrones -- An impressive feat, though the air of defeat and the constantly shifting POVs are not my cuppa.Redshirts -- This stood out mostly because the Puppies have been so rabid about it. But it's a fun read, and deeper than you might expect from its reputation and style.Carol Berg -- Any Carol Berg is an outstanding comfort read for me.The Girl with All the Gifts -- This one was close to 5 stars for me, and would have made it there but for some glaring logic failures that I couldn't forgive.The Penric novellas -- I didn't like the most recent one as much as the first two, but these are all filled with warmhearted goodness and LMB's trademark sardonic with.The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay -- Not in genre, but I'm counting it as such anyway since it has a ton of reminiscence about the birth of the comic book industry and lots of thematic connections with superheroes. Another book that I may raise to 5 stars at a later date. I love Chabon.Folding Beijing -- Hugo novelette winner, would probably deserve 5 stars with a more graceful translation. Like The Dying Earth, this one sneaks up on you and greatly rewards contemplation.Armor -- Loved most of the book, but it was hampered by political ham-handedness and predictability. I get the feeling that JL Doty, author of A Choice of Treasons (which I just reviewed last night), also loved it.The Wheel of Osheim -- Stands out more for its part in the series than in and of itself. I greatly enjoyed this series and its MCs, and thought it was more accessible and just plain fun than Mark's Thorn books.Seveneves -- Heavily flawed in some aspects, but also an impressive achievement over all. I actually placed this one first on my Hugo ballot, in large part because I thought it embodied what the Hugo is about.The Grace of Kings -- I don't know why this one doesn't get more love. Yes, it directly steals from a famous period in Chinese history, so you can't say it's entirely original. But I loved the characters, the complexity, and the balancing of ideals with corruption. A Chinese steampunkish (it's been called silkpunk) Game of Thrones.Uprooted -- Very engaging, but I fault it some for an overpowered MC and some sappiness around the climax. I said at the time I read it that it was likely to win the Nebula, and it did.The Vagrant -- Very imaginative, with del Toro-type monsters and a very goatlike goat. And how many books do you know with a mute MC who carries an awesome sword and an infant while hauling a goat along for the ride?Sorcerer of the Wildeeps -- Loved the prose in this one, and most of the story was very moving. I thought the plot went off the rails near the end, though.","Year":2016},{"username":"chris777","date":1471392000000,"title":"Another recommendation thread!","replies":0,"views":150,"text":"I had a post similar to this maybe a year or two ago.

A society characterized by human misery, as squalor, oppression, disease, and overcrowding. (dictionary.reference.com)Human misery, squalor, oppression, disease, overcrowding! Why on earth would we read about such things in our books? Why on earth would we watch such things in our movies? Perhaps it all comes from love. Love? What do you mean, you might say? I mean love. Love of our lives, or love of the lives we think we should have, love of the Earth, or the Earth we think we should have, love of humanity, or love of a humanity which could be. Because intertwined with this love one could say there is a fear. This is a fear that all the things we love will cease to exist or never have a chance to exist because our human weaknesses and moral deficiencies will destroy such possibilities. It is because we know that when that happens, dystopia manifests itself and becomes our new reality.When you look at the news and the world today, you can\u2019t help but wonder if dystopia is coming, or maybe we\u2019re already there. Mass shootings, climate change which many say is getting worse, increasing tension between Russia and America, increasing tension between China and America, increasing tension in general, wars and rumors of wars, religious extremism and extremism in general, an intense feeling and fear that our best days are behind us.The dystopian novel and dystopian story in general is what I consider one of our culture\u2019s many methods to examine the extreme problems which we face. These extreme problems are examined through a story which depicts a reality even more extreme than our own. It is a story with people and movements struggling and striving to realize and in many ways regain the promise of a better humanity. We want to believe that when the worst of the worst happens we will still have a chance to thrive and rebuild, the dystopian novel addresses those concerns.One common fear we all have is a fear of Big Brother. Big Brother? I have 3 Big Brothers so what am I talking about? I\u2019m talking about the novel 1984, in my opinion one of the best and most important dystopian novels in history. It\u2019s been years since I\u2019ve read that book, I read it when I was in high school I believe. I don\u2019t remember all of it but I do remember that concept, Big Brother, Orwellian, and Thought Police, concepts which we use today in our common discourse.This dystopian novel gave us that concept, gave us that terminology which we have used in order to label and contextualize our common fear of an overarching government power with limitless power over our lives.The story takes place in a world where government has full control over information, who gets that information and how that information is delivered. In the backdrop is constant warfare between the major states: Oceania, Eurasia, and Eastasia. Big Brother is a totalitarian figure who controls the government which this story focuses on, and uses that government to rule the lives, actions and thoughts of every single person. The government of Big Brother revises history in order to perpetuate its own legitimacy.That is the job of the main character in the story, to revise history and make it conform to government propaganda. The government uses Thought Police and various technologies to monitor people for thoughts against Big Brother and the government, and people who have these thoughts are guilty of ThinkCrime, which leads to terrible consequences if they\u2019re caught. The Government invents a new language called Newspeak, which is not an innocuous euphemism like \u201ctwerking\u201d, but rather a malevolent attempt to limit the ways in which people can express their thoughts and feelings. Through the story we examine this world with the character Winston Smith and his struggle with the system and his eventual resistance to it.Today the NSA seems to have limitless power over our information, and surveilling the population. According to Edward Snowden, they don\u2019t appear to care about having a strong ethical code in regards to that information and what should be done with it. Major tech companies have been caught manipulating information and images in experimental ways, which they have not always been transparent with the public about. And they say many of these companies hand over user information to the government in very questionable ways. Our President has the power to start wars wherever he wants, whenever he wants, and for whatever reasons he wants and right now the number wars our country is involved in has not significantly diminished.Our Presidential candidates and their allies are constantly denouncing PC (political correctness) and the perceived punishment people get from not following PC. Is this Thought Crime? Are there Thought Police?Where does all of this lead? Is this Dystopia? Many people believe we\u2019re already there. It seems clear that although the dystopian novel is fiction, it really isn\u2019t. In Thailand a couple of years ago, during protests against the government there, people actually did the Hunger Games salute to protest and show their allegiance to the Opposition. The government canceled showings of the Hunger Games in response because the symbolism from the movie and the symbolism it carried with the real life protesters terrified them.Why on earth would we read about such things in our books? Why on earth would we watch such things in our movies? We read such things, and we watch such things because such things are happening in our society, and in our world although to a lesser degree for the most part. We\u2019re searching for ways to understand these issues, process them, and figure out a way of thinking in order to resolve them. It\u2019s obvious that the dystopian novel is more than fiction, more than fantasy, more than escape, the dystopian novel is real life on an epic and extreme scale and it challenges us to look at our reality and think of where we want to be.This is why the dystopian novel is one story trend which I believe isn\u2019t going to die anytime soon in literature let alone movies.*Wikipedia was referenced while I created this post. I was trying to remember certain details about 1984. It\u2019s been awhile since I read it but I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about it lately.","Year":2016},{"username":"SFFWorld","date":1446940800000,"title":"Dystopia, why the definition is wrong by Kristin McTiernan","replies":19,"views":568,"text":"Dystopia: an imagined place or state in which everything is unpleasant or bad, typically a totalitarian or environmentally degraded one This is the accepted definition of a Dystopia, one writers and readers alike have embraced.

I\u2019m pretty new to the genre at large.  I read Lord of the Rings and Hobbit back in the early 1980s and have revisited each many times since, and a good deal of what I\u2019m asking for will be in line with certain aspects of the writing in those books.  Beyond that, I greatly enjoyed Watership Down (if that counts as fantasy), and last year read all of the Martin books in Song of Ice and Fire and have a mixed but not entirely unfavorable opinion about them, but they aren\u2019t what I\u2019m looking for really.  I\u2019ve dipped into Once and Future King, but never did finish it.\r\rThings I like and my prejudices:\r\r-Aesthetics and preindustrial background:  I\u2019m old, a classical pianist and chess fanatic, and my tastes in all manner of art, architecture, style, poetry, and music tend to be old too.  This does not necessarily hold true for literature.  I tend to prefer modern prose.  I\u2019m not looking for Beowulf or Le Morte d\u2019Arthur, etc.  This is more about the tastes and favor of the author.  In Tolkien\u2019s work I always get the sense that his style is consistent with an older man born in the 1800s, a semi-luddite Oxford professor with a taste for and understanding of older aesthetic beauty and the natural world.  I read a scathing review of the LoTR films by John Dolan that I mostly agreed with (I disliked those movies immensely) with a sentence saying that Tolkien\u2019s elves were \u201ca rare example of 20th century sublime,\u201d and I agree, but extend that to the books as a whole.  I do worry that younger writers just won't understand the older world if their whole lives have been dominated by strip malls, machines, car infrastructure everywhere, constant advertising, etc, and that their work will be artificial because of it - but it's just doubt; I'm not saying they can't do it.\r\r-A writer who is not afraid to be slow.  I don\u2019t require action all the time, and enjoy tension building, poetry, lore, and quiet scenes that flesh out the characters.  I like when a writer is attentive to day & night cycles and the need for characters to get some rest and food.  The action should be mostly accents and crescendo peaks, not primary focus all the time.\r\r-Language:  Beauty and clarity of prose is a concern for me, and I tend towards preference for British authors.  Ability to write natural dialog is important too.  \r\r-Character and plot control:  I do not want to have to balance 100 characters and plots in my head in the first 200 pages, etc.\r\r-A somewhat tight story arc:  I have doubts about series like Jordan\u2019s being able to sustain my interest or maintain the thread, and already a chief complaint of mine about Martin\u2019s aSoIaF is that I feel it's getting a bit serial.  It's not really about the number of books though, but rather about maintaining an organic arc of some sort and pushing the story along in a certain direction - even at tugboat pace.  I hope this doesn't come across as conflicting with request #2 above.  I don't want a big, meandering, groping soap opera series is all.\r\r-Cleverness.  I won't elaborate here much, but wordplay, smart solutions to dilemmas and puzzles, etc, avoidance of over-use of certain literary devices.  Over-reliance on deus ex machina is something even Tolkien suffers from badly, for example.\r\r-I have more or less feared modern fantasy books over the years because I felt they mostly would be clich\u00e9.  It's pretty obvious I\u2019m okay with some sort of Tolkien-like book in style and feel and aesthetic, but I don\u2019t want a Tolkien clone story.  (I have read that Terry Brooks' books are like this.)  A moving adventure with interesting characters and moments that inspire a nice neural wave of emotion from time to time would be nice.  I rated Watership Down right up there with LoTR for most of the same reasons I like LoTR, and that book had absolutely nothing to do with swords, elves, and magic objects of power, etc. \r\rThanks for any input!","Year":2014},{"username":"rabbithat","date":1402531200000,"title":"What are your dark fantasies for the Future?","replies":13,"views":5000,"text":"What are your dark fantasies for the Future?\r\r \r\rI'm looking for people with really creative imaginations, to come up with a short text of which imagine the dark fantasies of the future life will be like.

Dystopia as a creative device are often used to draw your focus to many real-world issues that affect our environment & politics, economics & religion, psychology, ethics and the science in our societies. The basic premise of dystopia is that, if these factors are allowed to expand and grow uncontrollably or without taking into consideration the human element in them; it could potentially lead to an alternate society or world. \r\rDystopia can be made more manageable and understood better if the individual, the lowest common denominator in every society is allowed the freedom to express himself fully and freely according to his or her desires. The actual life of an individual is what must constitute to be called the true essence or meaning of life, instead of blindly following an arbitrarily attributed essence that is defined by others, which is then in turn used to define us. Therefore we humans through our own consciousness must create our own values & beliefs to determine a more meaningful existence to this life.\r\rAuthor M C Raj creates such a dystopian society set in a future not too far from today and also creates a whole new planet, called B2, filled with a new order of life. And to round off a stereotype, it is America, the big & powerful and capitalist America and the man at the centre stage of it all, the American President who wants to capture & occupy this new planet and plunder away its resources for their own personal selfish desires. This ambitious plan runs into rough weather because the inhabitants of planet B2, unlike the ones you see on earth can\u2019t be fought and conquered over by the mere use of force and weapons because these beings do not have a definite organic form, they are more like life waves created out of the entropy of life thoughts & vibes that contain only positive energy. The American president Rustler\u2019s plans to overrun Planet B2 faces opposition not just from the hostile atmosphere of Planet B2, which doesn\u2019t allow any vessel or individual that carries negative energy entry into its sphere, he also faces opposition from his long time confidant and key man in this mission, Plumbel who gradually begins to preach a more peaceful line of existence and eventually joins forces with the German Chancellor who too is opposed to Rustler\u2019s evil plans.\r\rThis separation in idea and propaganda eventually leads to the entire earth being divided into two camps, those who agree with Rustler and are for the capture of Planet B2, form the Earth Alliance and those who are against it, headed by the German Chancellor forms the Cosmic Alliance. What happens next is on expected lines as another world war breaks out between these two opposing forces, but where this war becomes different from its predecessors is that this time war does spell the total end of humanity as we know it on earth.\r\rThe highlights of this story are the detailed narrative explorations about Carolina and Marissa, two Native American girls who were selected in the space mission to become a part of the nefarious grand plan of Rustler to capture the planet B2. Through them we get to know and understand more about the shamanistic beliefs and disciplines that the indigenous tribe groups follow. Philosophical ideas of getting back to nature and becoming one with nature reverberate throughout the passages involving the girls and then further with Plumbel, in whom we get to see a gradual transformation and metamorphosis from as another American jock with his head stuck in the clouds to someone who becomes more sensitive to the thoughts and feelings of not just the people around him but also gets in touch with his humane and natural side. And the idea of full body orgasm that has got nothing to do with sex but everything to do with the mind and its state of happiness sound very Osho ish in presentation. The fact that such a serious issue has been addressed in this sort of a simple, straight forward and slightly flippant manner and yet manages to keep the reader interested begets the praise that the author is due.  \r\rAlthough sometimes the novel does become slightly caricaturist at certain points, the author may be forgiven for that because as our everyday news headlines show us, sometimes reality does become an extension of the caricature that is essentially drawn from it to begin with. But sometimes you do wish that the author kept the same level of focus even when dealing with less significant sub plot as he does with the main plots of the story. But these are minor gaffes that don\u2019t necessarily stop the reader from enjoying the book. \rThis is a book that I wholeheartedly recommend to anyone who loves alternate fiction, ideas of existentialism, action & violence, faith & bravery, and love of a different kind, maybe the purest kind that there is. \r\rBe forewarned that it will have you sitting on the edge of your seat as each page draws close and thereby inching you towards a very explosive & graphic climax.","Year":2014},{"username":"Werthead","date":1377734400000,"title":"The SFF All-Time Sales List","replies":0,"views":209,"text":"Details on the list: this was assembled based on Wikipedia details, sales figures via author blogs and websitse, or info released publicly by publishers.

The Guardians have disappeared and are feared dead, but the reevers remain, overstretched and in increasingly few numbers as chaos and barbarism spreads across the land. Reeve Joss is given the difficult task of restoring order to an area in the south ravaged of bandit attacks, threatening trade between the Hundred and the Sirniakan Empire to the south-west.\r\rMeanwhile, in lands far beyond the Hundred and the Empire, a Qin warrior named Aniji marries a local woman, Mei, and finds himself and his troop of 200 soldiers drawn into danger and adventure, forcing them to flee their lands and journey into the Hundred, where they find the land on the brink of full-scale war.\r\rSpirit Gate is a compelling story set in an interesting and well-realised world. Whilst Crown of Stars was deliberately set in a very rigid society highly reminiscent of medieval Europe, Crossroads is far more original and fantastical, although the two works share some character tropes and ideas. The book opens with a nice piece of misdirection that holds the attention and directs the reader into the story. However, the pacing is mismatched and key characters, most notably Joss, disappear for long stretches. In other places the timeline is a bit confused, with Elliott not being afraid to revisit the events of several chapters past from another POV, although once you get used to it this plot device does start yielding useful information. There is also a rather odd tendency for central characters to engage in frivolous discussions and banter in the middle of mortal danger, which defuses tension from the book, and after a very impressive build-up to a major confrontation at the end of the book, the actual final battle is resolved in perhaps two pages at best, which is very disappointing.\r\rOn the plus side, the relationship between the reeves and their eagles is well-defined. Those fearing that the giant eagles were going to be reduced to cuddly sidekicks can rest assured that these animals are depicted as the dangerous creatures they are. The idea that the reeves are policemen and not soldiers is also nicely done and leads to some interesting exploration of the roles of the police and the military in a fantasy world.\r\rUnfortunately, the central threat in the book is left rather vauge and undefined. Is chaos and lawlessness returning in general because the Guardians are gone and some people are taking advantage of it, or is there a much darker master plan at work? Elliott hints at both possibilities but never really gives us enough information to come to a conclusion.\r\rSpirit Gate (***) is an enjoyable and solid fantasy novel with some very nice ideas which doesn't entirely come together satisfyingly. Still, the novel leaves me intrigued to read the sequel, which I suppose is its main objective.Click to expand...Book 2: Shadow Gate\r\rThis is the second book in the Crossroads series, and the middle volume of the first story arc, reportedly a trilogy (preceded by Spirit Gate, which I reviewed here, and to be succeeded by Traitor's Gate, due in 2009).\r\rIn Spirit Gate, a number of outlanders arrived in the Hundred to find the land beset by troubles. Armies of vagabonds and cutthroats have appeared out of nowhere to challenge the justice of the reeves, the giant eagle-riding police force who have ensured the rule of law in the land since the disappearance of the Guardians many decades earlier. The outlanders, led by Captain Anji and his wife Mai, joined forces with Reeve Joss and the militia of the city of Olossi to defeat one of these roving armies and build a safehaven in the south-west of the Hundred. However, all are troubled by rumours of beings wielding supernatural powers and riding winged horses - as the Guardians were said to have done - apparently leading the invading armies.\r\rShadow Gate is a worthwhile and enjoyable follow-up to the first book, mostly because it works on two levels. On the one hand, it is a direct sequel, following up on the adventures of Joss, Mai, Anji, Shai and others following the Battle of Olossi. On the other, it is also parallel novel to the first, explaining a great deal of the mysteries in the first volume. One of the key weaknesses in the first book, I felt, was that the nature of the winged horse-riding beings and some storylines, most notably that revolving around the wandering envoy-priest and the bizarre antics of the slave Cornflower, were decidedly under-developed, to the point where their inclusion seemed to be extremely confusing. In this second volume you get the answers to those questions, told in an accessible and intriguing manner. Any thoughts that this was going to be a simple good-versus-evil struggle go out the window as we learn more of the nature of the Guardians, the rules they operated under and some explanations as to why they disappeared (although the full story, I suspect, will have to wait until Book 3).\r\rAt the same time, we get to meet some new characters, such as Nallo, the refugee who is chosen to become a reeve but whose training is complicated when the main reeve base comes under siege, and Avisha, a simple village girl who attracts Mai's favour and has to sort out a complicated love life as well as caring for her family. The new additions to the cast generally give us new and interesting outlooks on the world and the plot, and don't slow the story down too much. The pacing is also good, but arguably the conclusion is not as strong as it might be. Just as the Battle of Olossi seemed to happen very quickly at the end of Book 1, so the two big set-piece battles at the end of Book 2 also get short shrift, but arguably this is less important this time around as revelations about characters and several dramatic scenes between major characters form the meat of the finale, which does a better job of leaving the reader wanting to pick up the next volume straight away.\r\rSpirit Gate (****) is a notably superior book to the first one, and actually makes the first one more enjoyable as well (a full re-read of the first book after the series is completed will pay unexpected dividends, I suspect). The book is published by Orbit in the UK and by Tor in the USA.Click to expand...Book 3: Traitors' Gate\r\rAn invading army is laying waste to the lands of the Hundred. The reeves, the giant eagle-riding police force of the land, are unable to hold them back. In desperation they have struck up an alliance with an exiled outlander prince and his militia, but the enemy are led by corrupted Guardians, resurrected beings with the power to look into souls and strike people dead with a glance. The only hope of victory may lie with the uncorrupted 'pure' Guardians. But to achieve this, they may have to give up a terrible secret...\r\rTraitors' Gate concludes the Crossroads trilogy by Kate Elliott, or rather it concludes the opening three-book arc of the series. Future books are planned picking up the story some generations further down the line. For now, however, it is a self-contained trilogy with no major cliffhangers or unresolved plot elements.\r\rIt's been five years since I read the first two volumes in the series, so I was initially a bit swamped as I caught up with what was going on. The core storyline is fairly straightforward, but the secret to the success of the trilogy is how Elliott layers in thematic elements to apparently trivial characterisation and how she addresses a wide range of different topics - from sexuality and female empowerment to commerce and religious freedom - within the confines of a more straightforward story. In fact, my biggest complaint about the trilogy as a whole is that it like it could have done with an additional book to help flesh out the world and cultures (a far cry from her prior Crown of Stars series which, whilst very good, could have probably done with at least a volume being shaved off its length).\r\rThe book and the trilogy as a whole also explores the concept of corruption and the ethics of the use of power. Elliott has little truck with evil magic or other examples of simplistic morality, instead citing that every person has within them the capacity for good or ill, the Guardians included, and she contrasts well the rigid thinking of the Qin (who prefer to see the world in absolutes rather than shades of grey) against those who are more open to a more complex view of the world. There's a good culture clash element which is not over-egged. There's also a feeling of melancholy to the story: the Hundred is an open-minded, tolerant land which has to become harder and more regimented to fight the invaders and in the process loses something of itself.\r\rThe worldbuilding is excellent - the Hundred is not another European medieval fantasyscape but an original creation drawing on many sources - and the characterisation is fairly strong. The pacing is a little off: for almost three-quarters of the length of the novel it honestly feels like there is no way of defeating the enemy and most of the time is spent on less-important character arcs, and suddenly everything spins on a dime. It is done reasonably convincingly, but certainly the ending feels a little abrupt. However, the ending is also deliciously messy. Allies suddenly find themselves at odds and what seems like deliverance could be (and we don't find out for certain) enslavement under a different name.\r\rTraitors' Gate (****) concludes an accomplished fantasy trilogy with intelligence and complexity. Elliott has crafted an interesting world here and it'll be interesting to see what happens there next. The novel is available now in the UK and USA.Click to expand...","Year":2013},{"username":"Westy","date":1354406400000,"title":"Your Best Reads of 2012?","replies":104,"views":8000,"text":"So what are you best reads this year - irrespective of when they were published?

For some reason the moderators saw fit to remove the topic, why I don't know. Anyways my question was whether or not anybody has read his debut \"The way of shadows\" and it didn't seem that many had. After reading what it was about I scampered of to the bookstore and bought the book. Now 2 days later after having read the first 650 page novel of his trilogy, which will have one book published every month in 3 consequtive months, I'm quite surprised why noone has mentioned Mr. Weeks before this.\r\rI thought \"The way of shadows\" was astoundingly good for a debut and I will definatly be buying the next 2 books of the series. Solid characterisation coupled with an interesting and fast moving storyline topped off with some nice plot-twists marks for a very good read indeed!\r\rA way of shadows is somewhat reminicent of Hobbs assassins apprentice series but as the storyline is much, much darker I have to say I forgot all about Hobb as the book progressed. \r\rThe story is about a little runt of a kid named Azoth who only has 2 friends, a mute little girl and a clever but weak boy who's name is Jarl. They are members of a guild consisting of children between 5-16 years old being led by a sickly guildleader and his cruel, sadistic right hand named Rat. Both Jarl and azoth are aware that they have to get out somehow and while Jarl has dreams of buying apprenticeship somewhere in the city Azoth dreams of being apprenticed to the deadliest assassin alive - Durzo Blint......\r\r\rI would easily rate this book higher than the hyped \"The steel remains\" by Richard Morgan. The prose might not be as good as Scott Lynch, Abercrombie or Rothfuss (although it is very good for a debut in my opinion) but both the story and characterisation shows so much promise that I think we'll hear more of Brent Weeks in the comming years. \r\rI highly reccomend his debut \"A way of shadows\" for anyone looking for a good fast paced read.","Year":2008},{"username":"sullivan_riyria","date":1325548800000,"title":"Best Epic Fantasy for 2011","replies":105,"views":9000,"text":"I've been making a few of the \"best of 2011\" lists:\r\r1 of 10 books in Fantasy\/Scifi from Library Journal\r#2 out of 5 from Only the Best Science Fiction and Fantasy\rBut yesterday Drying Ink selected Theft of Swords as The Best Epic Fantasy of 2011!

But I'm committing to making more time for what I truly love, so I'm going to make it happen! \r\rAnyhow, I'm going to list a bunch of qualities that I would like to see in a novel that I want to read now, and I ask you to think about those qualities and come up with books that fulfill as many as possible; try to avoid recommending books that have a single element that I mention but overall don't fit the picture, even if you like it so much that you want to recommend it. In other words, I'm sure Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is a good book, but I'm pretty sure it isn't what I'm looking for!\r\rI'm also going to list a bunch of novels that are along the lines of what I'm looking for; they might be rather different, but try to think of books that would fit in the same paragraph with these books.\r\rThanks in advance!\r\rIn no particular order, I'm looking for books that embody the following qualities...\r\r- Good writing - Not overly pretentious or excessive in use of cutting edge literary devices--actually, I'd prefer books that don't do that, at least not explicitly; my preference is for good, clean prose that can be poetic and beautifully written but doesn't read like an MFA grad's first attempt to come off as a Sophisticated Postmodern Literary Fantasist (in other words, no Hal Duncan please ). I'm thinking Ernest Hemingway or Ursula K Le Guin.\r\r- A Sense of mystery and wonder - Magic that seems magical (if there is magic; could be science fiction). A sense of lost civilizations, ancient history, myths and forgotten secrets. This may be the most crucial ingredient. I'm thinking John Boorman's Excalibur not Xena: Warrior Princess, or, in sf terms, David Lynch's flawed but evocative version of Dune vs. the bland Scifi Channel version.\r\r- Character Depth - Perhaps this goes hand-in-hand with good writing, but not necessarily. I want characters that are interesting, with depth and complexity; not Goody Two Shoes or the converse Evil For the Sake of Evil. I want characters that develop and evolve, that come of age, attain enlightenment, have multi-leveled purposes and motives.\r\r- Romance - Not necessarily excessive, but with romantic elements. How can a story exist without romance?\r\r- Easy on the Blood & Politics! - Too many epic fantasy and science fiction stories are focused on war and political machinations. I don't mind that being part of a larger story, but not the central focus; I get tired of endless descriptions of battlefields, complete with spurting severed stubs and bifurcated skulls (which is the main downfall of Erikson for me). I'm not particularly squeamish, I just don't get a thrill from gore. The same goes for politics, but to a lesser extent. I'd rather read about a protagonist with a sense of purpose and destiny that isn't tied to ascending the throne of such-and-such kingdom, but something more sublime, perhaps understanding who they are, why they are who they are, what the True Story of the World is, etc.\r\r- A Generous Helping of Philosophy and Mysticism - What is the meaning of life? The true story of the world? The nature of reality and consciousness? These sorts of questions are woefully under-explored in fantasy. If we're talking sf, I much prefer the Big Questions to Techtalk. \r\r- Did I say Epic? - OK, it doesn't have to be Save The World Or Everyone Dies, but it should matter, and it should concern Big Events and Interesting Times, if only in the lives of the protagonists. \r\r- Unique World Building - If I wanted faux Medieval Europe, I'd read a historical novel. On the other hand, novelty does not automatically equate with quality; in fact, it can often get in the way of it. What I'm looking for is living, breathing, otherworlds that seem real in and of themselves--whether fantasy secondary worlds or sf futureworlds. In my view, the bar is still set by Middle-earth for fantasy and Dune for sf.\r\rSome Books That I've Enjoyed That Fit My Criteria (To Varying Degrees): Fantasy - Earthsea Cycle by Ursula K Le Guin, Book of Morgaine by CJ Cherryh, Riddlemaster by Patricia McKillip, Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion by JRR Tolkien, Malazan Book of the Fallen by Steven Erikson (to some degree), Prince of Nothing by R Scott Bakker (I just wish he wasn't so damn dark--lighten up, Scott!), various works of Guy Gavriel Kay, Michael Moorcock, M John Harrison, and others; Science Fiction - Dune by Frank Herbert, Hyperion by Dan Simmons, Neverness by David Zindell, Book of the New Sun by Gene Wolfe, Lord of Light by Roger Zelazny.\r\rSome Books That I Hoped Would Fit But Didn't: Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss (it was solid, but didn't really pull me in...although I only read 100 pages), anything by Brandon Sanderson (he's OK, but he just doesn't inspire me), ASoIF by George RR Martin (I know, it is sacrilegious--I liked the first book but didn't love it--too dynastic\/war\/politics oriented--and then decided I'd just enjoy the excellent tv series), The Unremembered by Peter Orullian (still looking for a great new boy-saves-world coming of age fantasy; this wasn't it), Perdido Street Station by China Mieville (very well done, but too \"weirdness for weirdness sake...scarab sex?), etc.\r\rBooks I'm Hoping Might Scratch My Itch: The Fade or Retribution Falls by Chris Wooding, various Darrell Schweitzer books, Riyria Revelations by Michael J Sullivan, Castings Trilogy by Pamela Freeman, Od Magic and other books by Patricia McKillip, Lemurian Stone by Stephen Hickman, Mythago Wood by Robert Holdstock, House of Suns by Alastair Reynolds; a bunch of others on my shelf that I don't want to list.\r\rHopefully that paints a picture. Maybe as recommendations come in I can further fine-tune what I'm looking for.\r\rThanks!","Year":2011},{"username":"Zsinj","date":1137283200000,"title":"Books you just couldn't get through","replies":4,"views":1000,"text":"I'm sure this has probably been on this board before, but I was wondering, what were the sf\/fantasy books that, though you tried like hell to like and get into, you just couldn't, and you had to quit them, and why did you quit?

I thought of sharing my impressions of Mr. Asher novels\/ss here. On a scale to 10:\r\r Gridlinked: 10 - I like to try new authors both from here and the UK especially in my favourite areas (space opera and military sf) so in 2001 I got Gridlinked (bundled with Chasm City - to reduce postage costs I try to bundle several UK books together); after reading it I said \"Wow\" that is someone to buy on publication\r\r  The Skinner: 10+ - Usually the second book is not as good as the first but this time it was better. Loved Sniper\r\r  Cowl: 9 - I do not like time travel books unless the time travel is one way (blink and that Universe changes\/dissapears is too solipsistic for me) so I got this book because it had Neal Asher as author and I really liked it to my surprise\r\r  The Line of Polity: 8 - I really waited impatiently for this book and I was very dissapointed since it seemed too much a rehash, plus the Theocracy and all thing has been done to death and I do not like villains you cannot like or at least appreciate if only a little bit (I liked Mr. Crane, but Skellor or the theocrats both stupid and unlikable... Even Arian Pelter was more interesting...) Maybe I expected too much (had a similar experience with China Mieville where after 2 books I really liked came Iron Council which I almost could not finish...). On rereading The Line when Brass Man came out, I changed my mind slightly so I give it an 8 now, but still it is the weakest of the novels so far\r\r Brass Man: 10 - It was everything that The Line was not. Loved the rogue AI's subplot - thought it brilliant\r\r The Voyage of Sable Keech: 9.5 Very good, just a bit too similar to Skinner but still loved it a lot\r\r Short Stories: 9.5 I own both the Enginner (old edition) and The Writers of the Future book which has a group of stories \"Runcible Tales\" by Neal Asher and of course I read the Asimov's stories with the Gabbleducks.

We seem to be on a roll: older authors getting recognition from newer and broader areas of interest, new authors gaining their laurels and plaudits\u2026Yes, indeed; amongst the bland, the repetitive and the dross, there\u2019s actually a lot of great stuff out there.I\u2019m reminded of this again whilst writing this review. Reading the current successes - Erikson, Lynch, Gemmell, Barclay, and Abercrombie are often mentioned around at SFFWorld, not to mention the bigger names, (Martin, Jordan, Feist etc) - if I had to pick a trend in many of those tomes, it would probably be that Fantasy has become nastier, dirtier, more violent, more complex and yes, perhaps more adult in the last few years.Richard Morgan\u2019s first foray into Fantasy (previously known for his SF) is all of this, and more. And in a genre area currently filled with diamonds amongst the rough, it is one of the best books I\u2019ve had the fortune to read this year.   Richard\u2019s reputation for fast-actioned, violent SF has now been transmutated into a book worthy for any Fantasy reader with a strong stomach.I will admit straight away that I did get a sneak preview of the first five chapters. Normally such things don\u2019t sway me \u2013 though I am always grateful, I don\u2019t let such things affect my review. However, what won me over here was that it was one of those increasingly rare (but wonderful) events where I sat down initially to read the first couple of pages but ended up reading seventy-five. In one sitting. And I would have continued further had I got more.On the arrival of the full book, I continued. And by the end of the 400+ pages, I was very pleased about the journey taken.There\u2019s a lot in the story that many will recognise: indeed, Richard\u2019s postscript admits his homage to Moorcock, Karl Wagner & Poul Anderson. We have a young hero, Ringil (Gil) Eskiath, with an impressive war history, sword-fighting skill and an impressively vicious sword called Ravensfriend, crafted from superb kiriath steel. Ringil is asked to return to his ancestral home in order to do his mother (Lady Ishil, the aristocratical wife of  Lord Gingren of Eskiath) a favour, namely to find his cousin Sherin, sold into slavery. In order to do this, Gil has to travel, and so along the way we are introduced to more of his comrades \u2013 Egar the Dragonbane, the leader of a nomadic tribal group living on the steppes, and Archeth, the half-caste friend of Ringil, advisor to the mercurial Jhiral, the young Emperor of the Yhelteth Empire.As with his SF, Richard\u2019s characters here are a strength, and show much of what makes engaging personalities in the current genre field. They are morally ambiguous, not to mention sexually ambiguous. Like many books currently popular, the Hero (and Heroine!) are no longer clearly defined, which many readers will find likable. Grey is the colour, here, but here enticingly mounted in a brightly baroque landscape of varied geographical landscapes and diplomatic cultures.If there was a weakness, it is that in places I felt Richard\u2019s often excellent characterisation was too much, perhaps trying to be too edgy, too different (often the reaction to Moorcock\u2019s writing in the 1960\u2019s.) We have homosexual heroes, lesbian heroines (with a predilection for other races) and explicit sex and violence throughout. Sometimes the violence is quite extreme. The explicit language is not for the weak, either, but perhaps appropriate for the situation.This may deter some readers. And yet, for me, overall the main story is strong with an attractive back-story and the ideas nicely original enough to be memorable. There\u2019s a lot of creative invention here, from the maggot-like corpsemites who create zombie-like people at the start of the book, to the seedy city of Ishlin-ichan and the cursed, misty marshlands of Ennishmin. As the book evolves, it becomes clearer that more is going on here than at first meets the eye, with Wolfean touches of SF amongst the Fantasy. The scale of the tale is not particularly broad as, say, Erikson or Jordan, but it is fast moving, engaging and attractive.What does sparkle for me particularly, interestingly enough, is that the dark brutal edge of much of the book is tempered with a sense of (admittedly dark) humour and fun. The dialogue is at first jarringly contemporary, yet I was able to cope with difficult parents being called \u2018Dad\u2019 and soon settled down to go with the context. The story\u2019s ending is fairly secure, though there are points to be picked up in the next book, which may annoy some. The ending; however, is not as precipitous as some recent books.Those who know of Richard\u2019s SF, and like Fantasy, will be most impressed by The Steel Remains. There are going to be people who read this, not having read Richard\u2019s SF, who will be in for a shock. And that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. This was an eagerly awaited book which didn\u2019t let me down.Very highly recommended.Click to expand...RobB's review was a little less positive, though he did enjoy it:Richard Morgan is one of the hottest young writers in Speculative Fiction, he\u2019s already won a couple of prestigious genre awards for his efforts, including the Philip K. Dick award for his first novel, Altered Carbon, which was published in 2002 as well as the Arthur C. Clarke award for last year\u2019s Black Man\/Thirteen.  After five science fiction novels and two comic book storylines, Morgan digs his heels into fantasy with The Steel Remains.Like many a fantasy novel, one of the main themes hanging over the heads of the characters is war.  However, Morgan doesn\u2019t focus on war itself as much as the specter of a past war and the threat of a potential war.  In the protagonist Ringil Eskiath (Gil), Morgan captured an air of embittered veteran.  Ringil is called home by his mother to search for his missing cousin Shering, rumored to have been sold into slavery.  Ringil brings with him an enchanted sword, Ravensfriend, with the magical ability to can through anything. Unfortunately, Ringil\u2019s father and people from his town are dead set against his quest to save his cousin.  Adding fuel to the fire is the disdain Ringil\u2019s father holds over his son; despite Ringil being an honored war veteran, dad still can\u2019t look past Ringil\u2019s homosexuality.  Clearly, Ringil is a complex character who has quite a lot baggage, straddles many lines, and ultimately, comes across as rather genuine.Although the story is mostly centered on Ringil, Morgan surrounds him with a nicely drawn supporting cast, even if they aren\u2019t 100% likeable.  His mother, his father, his lover(s) and his enemies.  At times, Morgan is able to deftly maneuver some of those labels onto one character, and quite effectively. One of the most potent aspects of the novel is Morgan\u2019s unrestrained approach to both the sex and the violence.  The sex is intimate and graphic and the violence is on the same level of graphic description, as well as the sexual proclivity of the protagonist, Ringil.  Ringil does embody these two aspects very much, from the graphic nature of his trysts to the violent nature of many of his physical encounters with enemies, Morgan is unrelenting in how he puts Ringil into all of these scenes. The harsh language, the graphically depicted non-traditional sex, and stark reality of violence all add a stamp of boldness readers of Morgan\u2019s science fiction will find familiar. Some will (and have already) found these intertwined aspects of the novel off-putting. Too bad for them. As well as Morgan depicts the characters, what he does to an even stronger degree in The Steel Remains is depict the overall mood of the story and world in which it takes place. Ringil\u2019s world is filled with a great deal of tension and angst with the past of war ever-present as well as the fear of potential war in the air as well in addition to an overall feeling of melancholy and malaise. The word gritty, as I\u2019ve said in previous reviews, gets thrown around all to often and in that sense, the word loses some of its original meaning and potency. Here, I suppose, I would call the world in The Steel Remains gritty and harsh, it is dirty, uncompromising and very real.  One gets a feel for the dirt under the fingernails Ringil might have after much travel and war; the feeling of exasperation Ringil expresses in many of his encounters also epitomizes the mood of the story. The non-human characters, though somewhat physically similar to humans, have an air of alien and bizarreness to them.  The dwenda come across as Morgan\u2019s attempt at the elvish clich\u00e9, though with a more violent bent to them.  I\u2019d almost say they have something in common with vampires, too.  He also has shambling zombie like creatures, lizard men and akyia, which themselves seem one step further away from humanity than the dwenda.Morgan most closely details the mysterious dwenda, who have become nothing more than legend to Ringil\u2019s society.  As Ringil becomes further entrenched in the world of the slave trade, he becomes more entwined with the dwenda.  In a filmic sense, I found parallels between Ringil\u2019s journey into this dark underbelly of society with Nicolas Cage\u2019s character in the film 8mm \u2013 as Ringil became enmeshed in their world, it affected him in potent ways.As Ringil comes closer to finding his cousin and the novel\u2019s conclusion, he meets up with some former war compatriots, the barbarian Dragonslayer Egar and the half-human Lady Archeth. There are subplots involving Egar and Archeth, but Ringil is the primary focus of the story.  As such, in the conclusion, a prophecy given until Ringil pays off in frightening dividends as he realizes just what his truth of that prophecy is.  When this scene came into the plot, I found Morgan\u2019s skills to be at their highest, because here, he showed a great ability to bring together many ideas and themes of his story together.  Though this story ended with closure, that prophecy shows that Morgan\u2019s (and Ringil\u2019s) story are no where near finished. I found Morgan\u2019s first foray into the Fantasy to be quite enjoyable.  I don\u2019t know exactly what I was expecting, but what I wound up with when I closed the book was not quite what I thought I would get.  Having read Black Man\/Thirteen last year, I was hoping his approach to fantasy would be just as uncompromising and in that, I was pleased. Regardless, The Steel Remains is one of the more noteworthy fantasy novels of the year and with it, Morgan is continuing to carve a solid niche for himself in the genre, he\u2019s just now broadening his reach.Click to expand...So: Was the book worth such comments or is it an overheated overblown book, designed to do little more than provoke controversy?The thread is now open: over to you!Mark","Year":2009},{"username":"Roland 85","date":1286668800000,"title":"Daniel Abraham","replies":18,"views":2000,"text":"I know there are topics about The Long Price, but I couldn't find any dedicated to Abraham in general. I am sorry if I was wrong. \r\rSo, anyway, just finished Leviathan Wept and Other Stories, and thought I'd share my thoughts on it:\r\rI first heard Abraham's name when Hunter's Run  - his collaboration with George Martin and Gardner Duzois - came out. Since then he has been a constant presence in the blogosphere, and always mentioned with great admiration. So I decided to try his short fiction first, before jumping to The Long Price Quartet.\r\rLeviathan Wept and Other Stories is a very diverse collection. There is fantasy there, as well as post-cyberpunk, ghost stories, horror and just plain old comedy. The Speculative element is all but missing at times, but that steals nothing from the quality of the writing. And the quality of writing is very, very high. Abraham delves into disturbing topics with energy and determination, and doesn't shy away from uncomfortable truths. His style of writing is rich enough to allow the diversity of genres and themes, and the ideas around which the stories evolve, are - more often than not - rather original.\r\rThe Cambist and Lord Iron is a Victorian tale of a noble playing a bad joke on a money-changer, only to find himself in need of his services again and again, when he has to determine the value of more and more abstract concepts. There is no obvious supernatural element to the story, apart from some hints of the world being an alternative reality, but the focus of the tale itself is somehow outlandish enough to make it feel like fantasy.\r\rFlat Diane is a story of subtle horror and implied brutality, in which a father cuts his daughter's image from paper and sends it across the world to reconnect with distant relatives. Too late he realizes that he has sent away a part of his little girl's soul. And as she grows up, she is forever changed by the experiences \"Flat Diane\" has. This is perhaps the most horrific story in Leviathan Wept, and the fact that nothing actually happens for the reader to \"see\", that it is all \"off-screen\" and implied, makes it even more so.\r\rThe Best Monkey is the other story in the collection, bordering on horror, or at least that's how it felt to me, since altered humanity always chills me. In this particular case, the plot revolves around the perception of beauty, and what happens when that perception is changed.\r\rThe Support Technician Tango is perhaps my favorite in Leviathan Wept - a comedy about a malicious self-help book that wrecks havoc in the lives of all the employees of a law firm. It is witty, elegant and smart, and flows with such ease, that it's pure delight to read.\r\rThen comes A Hunter In Arin-Qin, a fantasy story that shares absolutely nothing with the previous four. Its protagonist is a mother tracking the demon who kidnapped her daughter. There is something of Gene Wolfe in this tale of unlikely revenge, both in structure, and in the atmosphere of mystery, of things left unsaid.\r\rThe titular story, Leiathan Wept, was a bit of a disappointment to me. It deals with analogies in a world where connections between people have maybe turned humanity into bigger organisms in which individual humans are only cells. And those organisms might be at war with each other. But what if there is only one, and it is just sick? Even though the idea is very interesting, and the story is well written, I found the development unsatisfying. The concept was intriguing, but remained vague, undeveloped, as if Abraham wasn't entirely sure what he wanted to do with it.\r\rExclusion is the story with the most interesting idea in the collection. It deals with a future society where technology has advanced to the stage where humans have their own AI systems integrated into their bodies, and those systems allow them to \"exclude\" other people from their existence. The Ignore function in a very extreme and literal sense, because contact with the excluded is impossible. You don't see them, they don't see you. You can't perceive them in any way, and neither can they perceive you. But what happens to a person's will and courage, when they can simply erase any problem with a thought? Unfortunately, the obvious happens - people prefer to run away from, and \"ignore\" the problematic relationships, instead of dealing with them. The story had great premise, and I sort of expected more than this simple moral from it.\r\rAs Sweet is another Wolfean tale - a poetic piece musing on the nature of love and passion, mixing different centuries but always getting back to Romeo and Juliet's (and more importantly - Rosaline's) Verona and the contemporary life of a literature teacher entering her middle years.\r\rThe Curandero and the Swede is a story about the importance of stories, and the way their meaning can change, and by changing - change us. It is the third tale reminiscent of Gene Wolfe's writing, and it deals with dusty roads, and Indian spirits, and Mexican witch-doctors, and all the right stuff that stories should be made of.\r\rAll in all, Leviathan Wept and Other Stories is a great collection. There are overarching themes in all stories, like that of sexuality. It is always there, sometimes obvious, others - just implied, but ever present. Many of the stories deal with IT and its evolution, and there is always some dry wit, no matter the seriousness of the plot.\r\rTwo things disappointed me a little. The first was the repetition of structure. Too many of the stories are structured in short passages that switch between some present and the slowly developing past that led to it. True, it is a tried and proven frame for a short story, but when you read it so many times in a collection by the same author, it becomes tiring. The second thing is that many of the stories revolve around a single idea, and when that is exhausted, they don't seem to have much to say. Examples of this are Leviathan Wept, Exclusion, and to a lesser extent The Cambist and Lord Iron, although the trend is recognizable in other places as well.\r\rStill, it couldn't have escaped your notice that in three instances I actually compared Daniel Abraham to Gene Wolfe. People who know me should be aware that there is no higher praise I could give an author, and Abraham more than deserves this praise. He has a rich and diverse style of writing, great ideas, and that indefinable energy that compels the reader to continue reading, no matter what. Leviathan Wept is a brilliant book, and I hope we see more collections of his short works soon. Meanwhile, I will soon be jumping into his longer ones.\r\r8\/10Click to expand...","Year":2010},{"username":"lifayt","date":1283385600000,"title":"End of the \"Stephenson\" road","replies":1,"views":650,"text":"I spent most of July visiting relatives out of country, and I had the opportunity to read the Baroque Cycle (among other things) while I was there.

The slow degeneration of epic fantasy literature, not to nothingness, just way down.  Before the cry of \"Foul!\" goes up, let me explain what I mean.  With authors such as Jordan and Martin \"writing on a treadmill\" (writing and writing and writing and getting no conclusion) I, along with many friend I know, gave up on The Wheel of Time and, to a lesser extent, A Song of Ice and Fire.  I probably will never finish Wheel, but I may finish ASOIAF depending on how long it take GRRM to finish.  He once confessed to me in an email, responding to an email I sent him, that it was his intention not to turn into the next Robert Jordan, but that he believed a story should have a beginning, a middle, and an end, and that he was planning on 6 books.  So much for that.  And that is what I am trying to suggest about the degeneration of epic fantasy, authors writing to make money, not to write, and losing interest among their readership.\r\r2.  The rise of Urban\/Modern Fantasy.  From Harry Dresden, through Harry Potter, to China Mieville, KJ Parker, and some Neal Stephenson, we have seen many great authors turn their pens towards a more modern magic story, with pretty good results.\r\r3.  Urban\/Modern Fantasy leading into the New Weird Movement.  China Mieville.  The VanderMeers, including the new advent of Weird Tales, Jay Lake, KJ Bishop, M. John Harrison, and Kathe Koja.\r\r4.  The New Weird has a threesome with Sci-Fi and Horror and the love child was called \"Steampunk,\" a distant grandson of Cyberpunk. A lot of steampunk authors out there fall into the easy trap of writing relying almost soley on the ideas of those who have come before them (i.e. Stephen Hunt, IMHO), but there are some generally original stories with creative characters in them out there.  Seems like Steampunk really took off, spawning its own major convention.  \r\rSo, my question to you, fellow enthusiasts, is, what will be the next big thing?  What directions are budding fantasy authors going to take?  Who is out there, in your opinion, that's doing it right now, doing something new, and what is it they are doing?","Year":2010},{"username":"manticore","date":1105920000000,"title":"Indian SFF","replies":9,"views":1000,"text":"To start off this forum, thought Id paste an article I wrote about the state of Indian SFF in English....\r\rA long, long time ago, in a country far, far away from the dwellings of the ancestors of Isaac Asimov and J.R.R. Tolkien, ancient Indian wise men wrote about flying saucers, death-rays, hideous alien monsters and incredible machines, setting down tales of wonder and imagination in massive epics that still enthrall the world. \rOur old tales are full of creatures and devices that make other epics \u2013 all subsequent world literature, in fact - look like non-fiction. Add to that our vast, sprawling panorama of folktales old and new, and you\u2019ll agree with me when I say that Indians are culturally geared towards a fondness for fantasy or science fiction \u2013 under whatever guise it masquerades in its twenty-first century avatars, be it alternative history, space opera, magic realism, cyberpunk, steampunk, speculative fiction or my personal favourite, Weird Fiction.\rYet unlike in the west, where SFF (Science Fiction\/Fantasy) literature has a huge market of its own and has achieved comparative literary legitimacy, in India SFF is still the far-outer-country cousin of Literature with a capital L \u2013 a mindset that will take years to break. It doesn\u2019t matter how thought-provoking or insightful SF is, or that the fundamental questions that speculative fiction asks about the human condition are the same as that of any great literary work, or that SFF lit offers a huge, colourful playground in which to study the numerous quirks of the human race humans have ever faced \u2013 at some level, say our self-styled lit-elite, SFF will always remain small-l, not-so-legit literature.\rA great many SF writers have gone off into long tirades about the beauty of the genre \u2013 how SF both reflects and inspires science, how Somnium, the first major western SF work, written by Johannes Kepler and published in 1634, is a landmark in world literature (it tells the story of a young Icelander who travels to the moon and is a response to discoveries about the earth made three decades previously by Copernicus.) In my opinion, SFF doesn\u2019t need a defence. Down the ages, Weird Fiction has catered to a variety of tastes all over the world; it has proven immensely popular, and will continue to be so long after its critics have been reincarnated as tapeworms.\rWhat is undeniable, though, is that until very recently a combination of a largely conservative mindset amongst the people who decide which way Indian publishing is going and the tiny size of the market for Indian writing in English have meant that there is hardly any Indian speculative fiction in English of note \u2013 which is criminal, given our country\u2019s oceans of fabulous resources, mythical, historical and social. \rWhen my first novel, The Simoqin Prophecies, was published in January this year by Penguin India, it marked a milestone (OK, more like an inchstone, but a stone nevertheless) in the story of Indian publishing in English. It\u2019s not very often that Indian publishers are willing to experiment, to stray from the conventional Great Indian Novel\/Memoir\/Exotic Guide path, and I was lucky that the market has matured enough for Penguin to give SFF publishing a shot, to decide that it was time for Weird Fiction to come out of the closet where it was lurking with miscellaneous monsters and rear its ugly head amidst the lofty heights where Indian Writers in English walk, converse, and eat steamed rice with lentil curry. \rWhich doesn\u2019t mean, of course, that my book was the first SFF novel an Indian writer has written in English \u2013 it was just the first book that was marketed as an unabashed genre novel, that didn\u2019t need to be hidden under a cloak, and smuggled into Literature\u2019s halls. Indian SFF writing in English has actually been around for a while.\rBy restricting the field of discussion in English I am, of course, excluding a lot of fabulous Weird Fiction in (other) Indian languages \u2013 in Bengali alone, the Upendrakishore-Sukumar-Satyajit Ray dynasty has given us a sparkling array of world-class speculative fiction, topped off by Satyajit Ray\u2019s charming SF stories for children \u2013 and any Bengali worth his fish will also tell you that Ray was the one who came up with the original idea we saw onscreen as Speilberg\u2019s ET. But we\u2019re discussing English writing alone, where India has also produced the World\u2019s First SF Award-Winning SF Novel Which The Author Didn\u2019t Consider SF \u2013 Amitav Ghosh\u2019s The Calcutta Chromosome, a fabulous, extensively researched and compelling tale about Ronald Ross\u2019 malaria research that won Britain\u2019s top SF award, the Arthur C. Clarke award, in 1997. I spoke to him at the launch of his new book (spoke is perhaps an overstatement, babbled like an incoherent fan-boy is more accurate) where I learned, to my infinite sorrow, that he doesn\u2019t plan to write more SF at the moment. Besides, he didn\u2019t think his award-winning effort was SF either. In an interview with Paul Kincaid in 1997, Ghosh said, \u201cI don't really think of The Calcutta Chromosome as being a genre novel. Science fiction tends to lie very squarely within the domain of the world's richer countries and it was a challenge, as an Indian writer, to write about science.\u201d \rIn any case, anything Amitav Ghosh writes is Literature. The same holds true for India\u2019s other great SFF writer, Salman Rushdie \u2013 and I\u2019m not just talking about magic realism being a very close stepbrother to genre SFF. Nearly all of Rushdie\u2019s novels contain SFF elements, but his first novel, Grimus (1975), was straightforward genre fantasy, based on the 12th-century Sufi poem The Conference of Birds. Grimus is an anagram of the name 'Simurg', the omniscient bird of ancient Persian myth. Rushdie\u2019s best fantasy so far is undoubtedly the wickedly funny Haroun and the Sea of Stories (1990) with its swashbuckling colourful landscape and tongue-in-cheek tributes to fantastical literature from Baghdad to Bengal.\rAn interesting case in the history of Indian SFF is that of Ashok Banker, author of the new seven-part Ramayana, which is being sold all over the world as genre fantasy, but, strangely enough, is being called a retelling of the epic, not SFF literature, in India. Banker, in his new avatar as a white-clad Hanuman-devotee, is the only Indian writer you\u2019ll find discussed on international SFF websites. In India, though, he\u2019s launched his books saying he\u2019s treading in Valmiki\u2019s footsteps. In either case, his books, which take the most incredibly material-rich epic in the world and add to it popular SF elements and monsters from well-known contemporary western writers, signal India\u2019s first entry into the big-league international SFF publishing market. He\u2019s currently working on a new-age Mahabharata, after which he plans to take on the take of Krishna as well.\rAnother big-advance Indian author, Ruchir Joshi, incorporated SF elements very effectively in The Last Jet-engine Laugh. And yet another Indian writer (well, he\u2019s British, but his father used to live in Kashmir once, so we are entitled to adopt him) who almost wrote SFF is Hari Kunzru. In a recent interview, he told me he\u2019s always been fascinated by alternate worlds and has always been a huge fantasy addict. Unfortunately for genre enthusiasts, he discovered early in life how to sell Literature to publishers for millions of pounds \u2013 though he also told me, in the same interview, how his next novel would be a fantasy about an Amazonian tribe visited by men from outer space. I wouldn\u2019t start booking advance copies of this masterpiece if I were you, though, since he\u2019s never going to write it.\rFollowing this impressive top order, there\u2019s me, with my little flag and trumpet, and a few others \u2013 Manjula Padmanabhan writes SF, as do the Dynamic Duo who write under the pseudonym Kalpish Ratna. In fact, the other day I found this story by Kalpish Ratna about the issues faced by cloned incestuous lesbian twins in post-apocalyptic Bombay. Fabulous! And Vandana Singh, author of the charming children\u2019s book Younguncle Comes to Town, has written for international magazines and aims to be an SF novelist. We haven\u2019t all met in dark alleyways with fake lightsabers in our hands yet, but I suspect we will soon.\rWhat is the future of Indian SFF? Search me, I don\u2019t know, but it can only be good. Sure, the scene now isn\u2019t too encouraging \u2013 the market is tiny, the foreign publishing market for SFF is completely distinct from the mainstream literary ones where a lot of Indian writers are big names, and this new crop of Indian writers still needs to have their SFF published abroad to stand a chance of making a living from it. But things will definitely change for the better \u2013 hopefully soon. We have writers of immense talent and stupendous imagination, an ever growing market, and a few editors and publishers who dare to innovate and give new genres a chance, no matter how boring the industry is in general. There are galaxies to be explored, and the first ships are already on their way. \rThen again, are you going to take my word for it?

Scratha's bizarre reaction throws the independent southlands into chaos: he hands temporary control of his family lands over to the king, takes on an assumed name, and sneaks out of the city. The king sends Alyea, a young noblewoman, to hold the ceded prize: but while she understands kingdom politics, she's quickly out of her depth in the byzantine world of the southlands. What she thought was a quick ticket to power turns out to be a dangerous assignment that may well lead her to a literal dead end. Just as trapped is Idisio, the orphaned street-thief sent by a chance encounter into Scratha's service. As his new and throughly unstable master goes undercover, Idisio finds himself drawn into the mysterious world of the desert lords and their secrets. Idisio's growing comprehension of the world he's stepped into doesn't just change his beliefs; it leads him to an unsuspected truth about himself that will change his life forever.About the AuthorLeona Wisoker got her start as a writer when she was eight, with a story about all the vacuum cleaners in the world breaking down at the same time. Ever since then she has successfully used the excuse of writing to avoid housework, even going so far as writing poetry (which is then safely locked away in a lead-lined box) when nothing else will save her from chores. Leona s work is fueled equally by coffee and conviction; she has been known to take over the entire dining room to deconstruct a difficult novel-in-progress. Addicted to eclectic research and reading since childhood, she often chooses reading material alphabetically rather than by subject or author. This has led her to read about aardvarks, birds, child-warriors, dragons, eggs, faeries, ghosts, horses, and many other random subjects. Her short stories have appeared in Futures: Fire to Fly and Anotherealm; she is a regular reviewer for Green Man Review and Fantasy Magazine. She has lived in Florida, Connecticut, Oregon, New Hampshire, Nevada, Alaska, California, and Virginia; has experienced the alternate realities of Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona, New York, and Italy; and believes that home is wherever my coffee cup is filled. She currently lives in Virginia with an extraordinarily patient husband and two large dogs, and she almost never vacuums.Click to expand...Here's a review from suciul and Cindy from FBC and one from Dark Wolf:http:\/\/fantasybookcritic.blogspot.com\/2010\/03\/secrets-of-sands-by-leona-wisoker.htmlhttp:\/\/darkwolfsfantasyreviews.blogspot.com\/2010\/02\/secrets-of-sands-by-leona-wisoker.htmlEDIT: Damn, I missed a previous thread on it... seems like it was posted in the short time I was away from the site:http:\/\/sffworld.com\/forums\/showthread.php?t=25998Can a mod merge it of possible?

To me Erikson's writing is evolving from kinda crappy (Gardens of the Moon) to great (everything subsequent).  And it is getting better, IMHO.  Most books I read are like a race to the finish, you want to see how the plot unfolds, what happens to the characters, the mysteries unveiled, and the ending is usually a grand finale of all that.  But, with Erikson its more like the trip there than the destination that's important.  His writing is enjoyable for the writing itself, and that is a rare quality in authors these days.  I can think of two other writers who are like this, Neal Stephenson and Stephen King.  Both of those guys are not known for their great endings of stories, which makes me wonder if Erikson's finale is going to be anticlimactic.  Are we going to bemoan the wrapping up of the Malazan Book of the Fallen series?  I hope not, but even so the journey there has been worth the price of admission.

This can be either the first Hardcover edition or the first paperback edition (for the paperback to qualify, it has to be the First paperback edition i.e. while Anathem by Neal Stephenson was first published in US Hardcover in 2008, the US paperback was published in August 2009 so it falls within the criteria for a 2009 release). If the book was published by a small press publisher prior to 2008 and received a wider release through one of the Big publishers this year. If the book, (like James Barclay\u2019s Dawnthief), was published by a UK\/Australian publisher earlier (2000 in this case) and received a US release in 2009.This topic resides in the Fantasy\/Horror forum, since it is the forum with the most traffic.

It's clear that the list includes both a decent sampling of core canonical works as well as a welcome sprinkling of more literary works.  Nice book capsule descriptions too.\r\rInevitably, everyone will have their quibbles and pettifoggery, and here are mine (I happen to have  read 80 of the 100 works listed, so I feel pretty well qualified to comment).\r\rAs abundantly noted above, some authors are overrepresented, consuming precious slots and stifling diversity.  I'd suggest that placing a maximum of three slots per author (and preferably only two), would better serve the goals of the list.\r\rAffected authors are: Dick (5), Haldeman (3), Heinlein (5), Le Guin (4), Martin (3), Stephenson (3), Vance (7), Wolfe (7).  Were it my list, I might change them as follows:\r\rDick (2: Valis and either The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch or Ubik)\rHaldeman (1: The Forever War)\rHeinlein (2: Stranger in a Strange Land\/The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress)\rLe Guin (2: The Wizard of Earthsea and either The Left Hand of Darkness or The Dispossessed)\rMartin (1: A Song of Ice and Fire series)\rStephenson (2: Baroque Cycle\/The Diamond Age)\rVance (2: Lyonesse trilogy\/Dying Earth)\rWolfe (2: Solar Cycle (gives you all 10 Sun books!)\/Wizard Knight duology)\r\rMany of these cuts were painful but necessary (Dick, Wolfe, and Vance are particular favorites of mine - respectively, I've read 36, 27, and 20 of their works).\r\rAdditionally, some authors with two works that I would cut back to only one work are: Asimov (not sure of the keeper), Card (keep Ender's Game, drop Speaker for the Dead), Simmons (keep Hyperion Cantos, drop Song of Kali), and Vonnegut  (not sure of the keeper).\r\rThe last cuts I'd make would be authors that would have trouble making a top 1000 list: Bradley (not so terrible, actually), Crichton (both books), Jordan, and Rand.\r\rSo far, the list is shorter by 32 books.\r\rNext, I'd tinker with some replacements as follows: Anderson (replace High Crusade with The Broken Sword or Tau Zero), Kay (replace Fionavar Tapestry with Sarantine  Mosiac), Lovecraft (replace Mountains with an omnibus - Library of America's H. P. Lovecraft: Tales gives you 850 pages of Lovecraft goodness), Silverberg (replace Nightwings with Dying Inside), Sterling (replace novel with collection, perhaps A Good Old Fashioned Future), and Swanwick (replace novella with collection, perhaps Tales of Old Earth).\r\rI might also replace the Dahl children's book with either Lewis' Narnia series, The Phantom Tollbooth by Norton Juster, or The Chronicles of Prydain by Lloyd Alexander.\r\rNow it's time to add new blood to the list.  Some works that I'd consider to be without question top 100 books (and likely top 10 material) are The King of Elfland's Daughter by Lord Dunsany, The Worm Ouroboros by E.R. Eddison, Solaris by Stanislaw Lem, and the Gormenghast trilogy by Mervyn Peake.\r\rOther works that belong firmly on the list are Crash by J. G. Ballard, The Wasp Factory by Iain Banks, The Last Unicorn and The Innkeeper's Song by Peter S. Beagle, Collected Fictions by Jorge Borges, Stand on Zanzibar by John Brunner, the Vorkosigan series by Lois McMaster Bujold, The Infernal Desire Machines of Doctor Hoffman by Angela Carter, Cyteen by C. J. Cherryh, Little, Big by John Crowley, the Well-Built City trilogy by Jeffrey Ford, Neuromancer by William Gibson, The Wind in the Willows by Kenneth Grahame, We Have Always Lived in the Castle by Shirley Jackson, Dr. Rat by William Kotzwinkle, Magic for Beginners by Kelly Link, the Constructors duology by Stanislaw Lem, The Forgotten Beasts of Eld and Od Magic by Patricia A. McKillip, Perdido Street Station by China Mieville, Gloriana, or the Unfulfill'd Queen by Michael Moorcock, Kafka on the Shore by Haruki Murakami, Babylon (Homo Zapiens) by Victor Pelevin, The Prefect by Alastair Reynolds, The Child Garden by Geoff Ryman, All the Names by Jose Saramago, CivilWarLand in Bad Decline by George Saunders, The Best of Lucius Shepard by Lucius Shepard, The Iron Dream by Norman Spinrad, Raising the Stones by Sheri S. Tepper, Blue Champagne by John Varley, The Once and Future King by T. H. White, Bellwether by Connie Willis, the first Amber series by Roger Zelazny.  Obviously, these works represent my choices at to the best of each authors work, but it was a tough call at times.  The easier task was deciding the authors to be represented.\r\rHaving added 39 new works, the modified list is now 107 items long, a surplus that I would cure by lopping off an additional 7 items from the somewhere in the bottom half of the original list.\r\rFinally, I'd place Nabokov's Pale fire at or near the top of the list, while not messing around with the remainder of the ordering, which is, as they say, close enough for government work.\r\rMy modified version of the list is more inclusive, somewhat fresher, and shifted more strongly towards the literary end of things.  Even so, there are at least 100 other authors with strong cases for representation, and several times that many works.\u200b\rI'd be interested in seeing the thoughts of experienced readers as to the list.","Year":2010},{"username":"Ponerology","date":1262563200000,"title":"Fictional drugs as a thesis... experts ahoy!","replies":110,"views":23000,"text":"I'm doing a postgrad lit thesis and I'd like to look at fictional (recreational) drugs- I'd love any input on interesting ways of examining the subject; plus possible sources as I am having difficulty finding much on this subject.

If you look back at this decade, who would you say were the best writers in our genre, and for what reason?\rDo you think publishing 1 or 2 very good books is enough to be considered, or do you require a wider range. Inspired by this question posed elsewhere, I posted the following in response:\r\rI don't know really.\r\rMy favorite series in all of Fantasy is still a Song of Ice and Fire. This decade has been a very difficult one for the writer though, and his output has been very limited, and not entirely succesful. I thought A Storm of Swords was a tremendously good book, and possibly the best release this decade. AFFC wasn't on the same level, sometimes actually annoying to read, at other times intriguing, but in the end no more than a 7 out of 10 rating. Nothing has displaced GRRM's series as my favorite series though, but I could not confidently call him the best SFF writer of the decade given what we have witnessed. He did have the wonderful Dreamsongs collection published but that was work from before this decade.\r\rRobin Hobb wrote the Tawny Man trilogy, which I thought was a truly wonderful series. Fool's Fate is the only other book from this decade that I enjoyed as much as Storm of Swords. But on the other hand the Soldier Son was an awful, deep disappointment. The Rain Wild Chronicles look to be redeeming her again. She would be one of the contenders, but the Soldier Son series prevents her from winning this for me.\r\rGuy Kay published Lord of Emperors, Last Light of the Sun and Ysabel this decade. He will have another next year. Another contender for me. A lot of people seem to think the books he wrote this decade aren't as strong as his earlier work.\r\rScott Bakker wrote 4 SFF books and I rate his series highly. Another strong contender.\r\rJoe Abercrombie published 4 very good books and in that sense he surpasses the other really good new fantasists of recent years, like Lynch, Rothfuss, Brett, Scholes, Newton, who all shows enormous promise but haven't published more than 2 books, which is too narrow a range for now. \r\rDaniel Abraham will be mentioned but I still have to read his work.\r\rNeil Gaiman had Anansi Boys and American Gods, both of which I liked, but calling his work the best of the decade goes too far.\r\rI liked the two books I've seen by Keith Donohue.\r\rJack Vance & Gene Wolfe are two authors from my personal top 10 but given their output I could not include them as nominees for best of the decade, understandable given their age, though Wolfe still publishes regularly. And he does have The Wizard Knight duology I suppose. \r\rI'm fond of JV Jones' Sword of Shadows series but in the end her writing has been similarly limited to Martin's, and has only published two books this decade, if we do not include next year's offering.\r\rSome of David Gemmell's later books like the Rigante quartet and the Troy Trilogy are some of the best books he's written.\r\rSusanna Clarke had Jonathan Strange, but that is just one book, be it a very big one.\r\rDan Simmons publised Ilium, Olympos, The Terror & Drood. It would be hard not to consider him given all that.\r\rNeal Stephenson wrote the Baroque Trilogy, which I did not care for, and Anathem. \r\rI would actually bring Jeffrey Ford in here. His career really took off this decade with strong and succesfull novels in The Girl in the Glass, The Shadow Year, and The Portrait of Mrs Charbuque is from this decade as well though I didn't care for that one. Aside from that he released no less than 3 fantastic short story collections ( The Fantasy writer's assistant, Empire of Ice Cream and The Drowned Life). He's a contender.\r\rThen there are guys like Steven Erikson and Jim Butcher who have had truly tremendous output this decade as well as commercial success, but I would be very reluctant to put them up as nominees here, for differing reasons.\r\rChina Mieville had a sizeable output and I suppose people will consider him. 5 novels and a short story collection, plus a new book due in 2010.\r\rIt will be interesting to see if other people here can make a strong case for a particular author.","Year":2009},{"username":"clockwirk","date":1145059200000,"title":"John Marco:  should I keep going?","replies":83,"views":10000,"text":"So I checked out \"The Eyes of God\" from the library 'cause I had heard he was the next big thing in fantasy, and I've read about 150 pages of it and I can't stand it!

I've read a few articles about this which include a new Neal Stephenson book that's clearly sci-fi being marketed as literature so that Borders will carry it.\r\rNow there have been books that are found in the \"literature\" section that are clearly fantasy\/sci-fi before (1984, Brave New World, Gulliver's Travels), but this brings things to a whole new level.\r\rIt's like Borders is saying, \"We don't want to be the bookstore that nerds hang out.\"  Well who the hell do you think reads books in the first place?  All you got is nerds, hipsters, and people trying to be a better salesman in 10 days.\r\rMost books that have made a poignant statement about society have been in the science fiction category and it's always bothered me that those books aren't included in school literature classes because \"sci-fi isn't literature,\" just like comics aren't literature cause it's all about a bunch of guys in spandex shooting lasers from their eyes.

However, local franchisees aren't allowed to expand that particular section if it does sell.  They aren't given that freedom by the corporate head honchos.  I translate this as a snubbing.

Compared to TV, where audience figures are easily available, and movies, where box office figures are even more easily retrieved, book sales figures are virtually impossible to calculate for an interested member of the public. The advent of the BookScan system in the USA has made this slightly easier, but the system is relatively new (introduced in 2001), it doesn't pick up every sale (according to Nielsen it tracks about 70% of sales) and only works in the USA (whilst more than half of the sales of titles take place outside that market). The New York Times and the UK Times offer their own figures, but refuse to disclose how those figures are reached. Publishers generally don't publish figures at all unless the book gets picked up for a movie option, or if the sales reach phenomenal levels. And of course often when figures are given they are for 'books in print' (i.e., the total number of copies of a book that exist, including those sitting unsold on bookshelves) rather than for books actually put through the till. Add to this the recent upswing in pirating books online, and the number of books where illegal or untracked editions have been printed in nations with a relaxed attitude to copyright, and you can see the difficulties faced in assembling any kind of all-time bestseller list.For that reason, the following list should be taken with a grain of salt the size of Lake Michigan (the source for most of the figures is Wikipedia, unless otherwise noted):1) J.K Rowling (350 million)The Harry Potter series has been a phenomenon the likes of which publishing has never seen. In less than a decade, Rowling went from an impoverished single mother writing in an Edinburgh cafe to one of the richest women in the world, overtaking dozens of writers who had been working for decades in the process.2) Stephen King (350 million)In The Encyclopedia of Fantasy (1996), it was stated that Stephen King's total worldwide sales in all languages are probably incalculable, and the figure given above is on the conservative side of things. I've seen some figures suggesting he has sold twice this amount, but the 350m figure seems to crop up most often. Some may argue that Horror isn't necessarily part of the SF&F genre either and King shouldn't be counted, but most of his horror features supernatural forces, which firmly places it as a subset of Fantasy. Also, no-one would really argue that Eyes of the Dragon and the Dark Tower series aren't fantasy, and both of these works are set in the same multiverse as most (or, as some fans argue, all) of his other books, which puts him firmly in the Fantasy genre.3) JRR Tolkien (c. 300 million)Tolkien's sales really are incalculable, given how widely his books have been copied, published without permission and distributed worldwide in the last fifty years. However, it is pretty clear that by itself The Lord of the Rings is the biggest-selling single genre novel of all time, and possibly the biggest-selling single novel full stop of all time. 50 million copies of the novel have been sold this century alone. When you factor in the massive sales of The Hobbit, and the smaller but still significant sales of The Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales and The Children of Hurin, plus his non-Middle-earth work, Tolkien is clearly a major force in SF&F publishing, arguably all the more notable as his output was small compared to some others on this list.4) CS Lewis (120 million)It is perhaps fitting that Tolkien's one-time best friend and sometimes collaborator should be next on the list. The 120 million sales is allegedly for his Chronicles of Narnia series by itself, and doesn't include his numerous non-fiction books or his other novels, such as his Space Trilogy.5) Anne Rice (100 million)A surprisingly high number from an author who hasn't produced a truly noteworthy book in some time.6) Terry Pratchett (55 million)Up until Rowling overtook him around the turn of the century Pratchett was a bona-fide phenomenon, publishing at least two novels a year for almost twenty years and being responsible for the sales of over 1% of all books sold in the UK and his books hitting the top of the Times bestseller lists like clockwork. Major success in the USA had eluded him until The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents won the Carnegie Prize in 2001. Following on from that, his US profile steadily rose until his books began hitting the NYT bestseller list as well. Aside from the occasional bit of mickey-taking, Pratchett was good-natured about losing out on his position as Fantasy's biggest-selling living author (with the King debate still going on) to Rowling, although his ire was provoked when some Potter fans complained that Equal Rites (1987) ripped off Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (1997), demonstrating a flexible interpretation of causality. Whilst Pratchett has now been firmly overtaken by Rowling, he bore it with equanimity and proudly maintains his position as the UK's most shoplifted author.7) Robert Jordan (44 million)Given how it dominates the discussion on some forums, this would seem to be a fairly lowly position for the biggest-selling of the modern epic fantasists. However, by any standards this is a seriously impressive number of books sold, especially given that the sales are split between a relatively small number of books (I suspect his Conan and Fallon novels' sales are all but negligible compared to those of The Wheel of Time sequence).8) Terry Goodkind (25 million)Pinning down concrete figures for Goodkind is harder than most due to some truly batty figures being circulated by his fanbase (at one time claiming he was Tor's biggest-selling author but failing to account for why only half as many copies of his latest book had been printed than Robert Jordan's). The worldwide figure of 25 million seems to be well-supported, however.9) Terry Brooks (21 million)Recently, with the announcement that movie versions of The Elfstones of Shannara and The Sword of Shannara are in development, it was suggested by some papers that Brooks was the 'second-biggest-selling living fantasy author', which would appear to be hyperbolic. An interview with JIVE Magazine reveals them to be rather more modest, although still extremely impressive. His books have sold very well for more than thirty-one years and Brooks, along with Donaldson, arguably kick-started the entire modern epic fantasy subgenre and has been one of its most reliable and visible writers ever since.10) Margaret Weis & Tracy Hickman (c. 20 million)This one was a bit of a guesstimate, coming out of discussions over these two authors' success on a message board several years ago. The figure is certainly highly plausible, with TSR claiming that more than 4 million copies of their Dragonlance Chronicles and Legends trilogies by themselves had been shipped in less than a decade, and this doesn't account for their gaming products, other Dragonlance books and numerous non-Dragonlance novels, many of which have been bestsellers as well.11) Frank Herbert (18 million)If there's one thing this list has proven, if you want to be a massive-selling author you're far better writing Fantasy than Science Fiction, unless your SF novel features a ton of Fantasy elements. Frank Herbert's Dune is SF's biggest-selling single novel, with more than 12 million copies by itself sold. I'd also make a fair guess that the other 6 million sales are comprised almost entirely of his other five Dune novels.12) Eoin Colfer (18 million)The author of the Artemis Fowl series, which has proven a massive hit amongst YA circles. Colfer was recently picked to write the sixth Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy novel, following on from the works of...13) Douglas Adams (16 million)...whose exceptionally long periods of writer's block and multiple years spent writing very slim novels, not to mention a poor film adaption of his signature novel, haven't affected his immense popularity.14) Kevin J. Anderson (16 million)Whilst his Dune novels co-authored with Brian Herbert may have been critically mauled, that hasn't stopped them selling like hot cakes. When combined with his popular Star Wars and X-Files novels, not to mention original works like the Saga of Seven Suns series, Anderson clearly doesn't have anything to worry about.15) Raymond E. Feist (15 million)The author of the extremely long-running Riftwar Cycle of novels, which when complete will comprise approximately thirty books. Mixed reviews for his books published over the last decade or so do not seem to have influenced his legions of loyal fans.16) Christopher Paolini (12 million)His Eragon Trilogy (now in four parts) may have been ripped into by the critics with a vengeance, but his popularity is clear. In fact, his sales are all the more impressive considering they are largely based on just two books, with his third only released in the last few weeks.17) Stephen Donaldson (10 million)Possibly a surprisingly low showing for Donaldson. His Lord Foul's Bane, published in 1977, kick-started the modern epic fantasy explosion alongside Brooks' Sword of Shannara. However, unlike Brooks who has continued to work in the Shannara universe ever since, Donaldson spent a whole decade trying to stay away from his signature character with works such as Mordant's Need and the superlative Gap series before recently returning to the series, and the bestseller lists, with The Last Chronicles of Thomas Covenant.8) Laurell K. Hamilton (6 million)Sex sells, obviously, especially when combined with werewolves and vampires.19) George RR Martin (c. 3-4 million)Again, another guesstimate based on discussions from various forums and the recent revelation that the Song of Ice and Fire series has sold 2.2 million copies (at least in the USA). GRRM is one of the highest-profile authors in the genre and A Dance with Dragons must be one of the most-discussed unreleased books in genre history. Much to the discontent of those who'd prefer he spent his time on Song of Ice and Fire and nothing else, his recent Wild Cards books have been strong sellers for Tor, and his Dreamsongs retrospective was a significant success as well. I suspect this figure is leaning to the conservative side of things, especially given how big Wild Cards was back in the 1980s.20) Neil Gaiman (2 million)If GRRM's figure is conservative, this is even moreso, and based solely on the figures I could find for sales of the Sandman graphic novels. Add in his other, highly successful novels and his real sales and position should be much higher.21) Peter F. Hamilton (2 million)The modern lord of space opera has shifted an impressive number of his brick-thick novels and with his US profile now growing rapidly, I suspect he's going to get even bigger in the years to come.22) John Ringo (2 million)The mildly controversial US author (\"Oh John Ringo No,\") of military science fiction is clearly enjoying the fruits of his success. People may be wondering where his sometimes-collaborator David Weber is, so I direct them to the 'Unplaced' list below'.23) Robin Hobb (1 million)A surprisingly low placing for one of fantasy's highest-profile and most prolific authors? Possibly. This was the figure given by HarperCollins Voyager in 2003 on the completion of her Tawny Man trilogy and applies solely to the nine books published under the Robin Hobb pseudonym in the UK up to that point. They do not include her earlier Megan Lindholm books, nor her later books, nor most importantly her US sales, all of which would likely make her position much higher.24) David Gemmell (1 million)Considering how many books he wrote (over 30), this figure may seem a little low. However, Gemmell never entirely cracked the American market, despite being a massive seller in the UK.25) Steven Erikson (c. 500,000)This may be even more of a surprise. The original source for the figure was Bantam UK, who announced shifting 250,000 copies of the Malazan Book of the Fallen in the UK in 2006, upon the publication of The Bonehunters. Given another two books have come out since then, and taking into account his Canadian and American sales, a doubling of that figure seems reasonable, although I suspect the true figure would be slightly less than this.UnplacedThere's obviously a huge number of authors I couldn't find reliable figures for, many of whom would be fairly highly-placed on the list.

Phew!\r\rWhilst obstinately a GRRM fansite, Westeros is notable for having an extremely varied and active 'other literature' section, and it was surprising that most people did not vote GRRM as their number one choice. That said, he was just about the only author everyone voted for, explaining his landslide win (he was 100 points above Tolkien, who in turn was about 100 points above the next person).\r\rMajor surprises: Bakker getting such a high placing. He's a bit of a Marmite author and doesn't have the highest profile. However, his work has definitely struck a major chord among those who have read him, and he got a lot of top scores.\r\rJoe Abercrombie was a bit of an eye-opener as the newest author on the list. However, his debut trilogy has attracted a colossal amount of attention and the pitch-perfect ending to the series (something very few authors, even the best ones, can handle correctly) is probably the single thing most responsible for getting him on the list.\r\rMajor upsets: very low placings for Gemmell, Banks and Bradbury. No votes at all for Rowling, Baxter or Rankin.\r\rIt was an interesting vote. Most book-based websites are heavily US-oriented or heavily UK-based, but this one is fairly evenly balanced between the US, UK, Europe and Australia. It definitely shows that fantasy is in the ascendence over SF at the moment (although GRRM, Bakker, Donaldson and Wolfe are all SF authors as well as fantasy ones, the highest placing for a 'pure' SF author is tenth), which is something I think we already knew.","Year":2008},{"username":"algernoninc","date":1205625600000,"title":"History Books for the fantasy readers","replies":16,"views":1000,"text":"Inspired by a recent thread on SF for fantasy aficionados, I'm trying now to identify some fat reads to insert between my epic fantasy series.\rBasically, if you take the magic out of the equation you are left with political plotting, quests for secret items, battles and duels between heroes, detailed worldbuilding, coming of age teenagers finding their place in the greater scheme of things, and so on.\rSo I'm looking for some detailed historical fiction, with a complex storyline and enough action, large cast of characters, etc. For example:\rKen Follett - Pillars of the Earth\rJames Clavell - Shogun\rBernard Cornwell - Grail Quest [the one with the archer, not the Sharpe books, which I found too lightweight]\rAlexandre Dumas - The Musketeers books\r\rI was hoping you can have some less obvious titles.

However, for those who might not know, Terence Dean \u2018Terry\u2019 Brooks is a globally recognised fantasy writer whose books regularly appear on the New York Times bestseller lists. In fact, in 1977 his first published book, The Sword of Shannara, was the first fantasy book to ever appear on the lists and remained there for over five months. All of his published books remain in print. In terms of global sales, Terry ranks as the fourth bestselling Fantasy author worldwide, behind only J.R.R. Tolkien, J.K. Rowling and C.S Lewis. The importance of The Sword of Shannara on the growth of Fantasy as a genre can\u2019t be overstated. In my own case, back in the oh-so-barren wilderness of UK Fantasy in the seventies, there was very little Fantasy to find. As (I was then), a young teenager, frantically searching libraries and bookshops for new Fantasy to read, there was very little, certainly by today\u2019s standards. To my recall there was Ursula K. LeGuin\u2019s Earthsea series, T.H. White\u2019s The Once and Future King, Tolkien\u2019s The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings, of course (but no Silmarillion yet, which appeared in its novel form in the same year), the new arrival of Stephen Donaldson\u2019s Thomas Covenant and\u2026. that was about it.And then there was the phenomenon of The Sword of Shannara. For fans of Fantasy, there was a lot to like. The story involved a band of heroes, (led by half-elf Shea Ohmsford), fighting for good against difficult foes, whilst searching for a mystical sword which would defeat the evil Warlock Lord. Lighter in tone than Donaldson and Tolkien, there were nevertheless all the elements of an exciting adventure, with likable (and dislikable) characters, elves, orcs, magic spells and powers, prophecies, strange places and, (perhaps most excitingly for a young adolescent male), a sense of direct action and purpose. Terry has said about Sword that: \u2018\u2026.in 1965 I read J. R. R. Tolkien\u2019s The Lord of the Rings, and I thought that maybe I had found what I was looking for. I would set my adventure story in an imaginary world, a vast, sprawling, mythical world like that of Tolkien, filled with magic that had replaced science and races that had evolved from Man. But I was not Tolkien and did not share his background in academia or his interest in cultural study. So I would eliminate the poetry and songs, the digressions on the ways and habits of types of characters, and the appendices of language and backstory that characterized and informed Tolkien\u2019s work. I would write the sort of straightforward adventure story that barrelled ahead, picking up speed as it went, compelling a turning of pages until there were no more pages to be turned.\u2019 (page 188, Sometimes the Magic Works.) The book plot was, admittedly, similar to Tolkien, but an engagingly rewritten one \u2013 easy to read and understand. For my teenage self, the pages flew by with narrow escapes, vigorous battles and apocalyptic overtones. My hungry teenage mind saw this as a huge block of accessible, fast-moving and lively high fantasy.This was clearly noticed by others than myself. Marketed in the US at first as \u2018a book to read after you\u2019ve read Lord of the Rings\u2019, the book was a global sales phenomenon. Sales of over a million were reported in the US, whilst in the UK (admittedly a much smaller market) sales were very strong. Lester Del Rey, editor at Ballantine Books, used the book to launch in the US the very successful Ballantine Del Rey imprint, still a major book publisher today, and the publisher Terry is still signed to in the US.With the enormous popularity of The Sword of Shannara, other Shannara books from Terry soon followed, extending and expanding the series. The Elfstones of Shannara (1982) and The Wishsong of Shannara (1985) continued the story of the Ohmsfords. In Elfstones the grandson of Shea Ohmsford, Wil, uses the eponymous stones to overcome another challenge, but by doing so, the blood of Wil\u2019s descendants is altered, resulting in his children being born with magic in their blood. Consequently, their skills are needed repeatedly through future events.  The Heritage of Shannara sequence \u2013 a continuous sequence composed of The Scions of Shannara (1990), The Druid of Shannara (1991) The Elf Queen of Shannara (1992) and The Talismans of Shannara (1993) - is a continuation of the story 300 years after the original trilogy. The First King of Shannara (1996) is a prequel to the first trilogy, dealing with the eponymous Jerle Shannara of the title.Later series, such as The Voyage of the Jerle Shannara trilogy - Ilse Witch (2000), Antrax (2001), Morgawr (2002) \u2013 jump ahead to continue to tell the tale of Shannara in future generations: in this case, 130 years after The Heritage of Shannara sequence. Similarly, the High Druid of Shannara trilogy (Jarka Ruus (2003), Tanequil (2004) and Straken (2005) is set 20 years after the events of The Voyage of the Jerle Shannara series. As the series has progressed, prehistory has been recounted and different aspects of Terry\u2019s world developed: the history and structure of the Druids, the backstory of Terry\u2019s Elves, Dwarves, Trolls and Gnomes as well as the expansion of the Four Lands, for example - to the point where in the last few books there have been subtle developments blurring the boundaries between SF and Fantasy. Throughout all of this lengthy and increasingly intricate series, fans have been introduced to Fantasy by it, enjoyed it and (perhaps most importantly) stayed, demanding more from Terry as time has gone on. The use of keystone character values and mythological events throughout, a lively pace, the detailed world-building, the smooth style and deceptively complex use of traditional epic fantasy themes have meant that, as the number of Terry\u2019s fans have increased, his influence on the genre and other writers has been enormous. Other authors have also spoken of Terry\u2019s importance. Philip Pullman, author of Northern Lights \/ The Golden Compass, has said of Terry, \u2018Terry\u2019s place is at the head of the fantasy world\u2019. He has further been described as \u2018the godfather of American fantasy\u2019 and may therefore be partly responsible for the healthy growth of the field to the position it holds in fiction today. At many websites, (including SFFWorld, where I am a staff member), one of the most common recommendations by members for teenage newcomers to the Fantasy genre, alongside The Hobbit and Harry Potter, is the Shannara series.Throughout his writing career, Terry\u2019s writing style has shown a number of characteristics: most prominently that his easily readable and approachable prose has also had a sense of fun running through it. A good example of this is Terry\u2019s humorous Landover series - Magic Kingdom for Sale - Sold! (1986), The Black Unicorn (1987), Wizard at Large (1988), The Tangle Box (1994) and Witches' Brew (1995) which tell the tale of Ben Holiday, buyer of a magical kingdom with unexpected hidden complications. Part Mark Twain\u2019s A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur\u2019s Court, part Baum\u2019s Wizard of Oz, part Sprague de Camp \/ Fletcher Pratt\u2019s Incomplete Enchanter, it was a series that was written whilst taking a sabbatical from writing the Shannara series. Introducing characters such as Abernathy, the court assistant (who also happens to be in the form of a dog), and Questor Thews, the inept court magician, it is an entertaining read. It is also perhaps an interesting glimpse into a turning point in Terry\u2019s own life, as it was Magic Kingdom (Terry\u2019s fourth book) that was the first book written by Terry as a full time writer. As the earlier part of Terry\u2019s career was as a practicing attorney (before becoming a full-time author) it is possible to see Magic Kingdom as a protracted goodbye to his previous employment before embarking on following his dreams, albeit with a lot of fun. The books have been optioned for an (as yet unseen) movie. Another book in the series has been promised by Terry soon. At other times, Terry\u2019s self-imposed need to broaden his resume has led to darker and more controversial works. His Word and the Void series - Running with the Demon (1997), A Knight of the Word (1998) and Angel Fire East (1999) is a series of contemporary novels initially set in the area of his birth \u2013 Illinois \u2013 where Terry spent much of his early life. Again, the theme of good against evil is prevalent. Knight of the Word John Ross and half-demon Nest Freemark use magic given to them by the Word (the embodiment of good in the world) against each other and then to prevent mankind from being overcome by the demonic forces of the Void. Here we are about as far away from the genre clich\u00e9s of cute elves and cuddly dragons as we can get. The work is grittier, grimmer and very much darker than the earlier Shannara novels to this point, dealing with death, child abuse and familial and societal disintegration. At times reminiscent of the apocalyptic vision of Stephen King\u2019s Gunslinger, but with Terry\u2019s own vision, the work is complex and fast-paced, amalgamating fantastical magic with current (or at least Reagan-era time) society events in the US. It is my favourite series of Terry\u2019s work to date, and predates the current popularity of urban fantasy (books by writers such as Kelley Armstrong, Jim Butcher, Laurell K. Hamilton, Charlaine Harris, Kim Harrison, Caitl\u00edn R. Kiernan, and Tanya Huff, for example) by at least a decade. Terry has also written movie novelisations for major films \u2013 for Steven Spielberg\u2019s Hook (1991) and, more recently, George Lucas\u2019s Star Wars: The Phantom Menace (in 1999.) This process has had a mixed reaction from Terry, though the process of novelising a key aspect of the Star Wars universe seems to have been an enjoyable one. In addition, a number of his own books have been optioned for film. Though none have yet appeared, most recently Warner Bros has bought the movie rights to the Shannara Series and may base the first movie on The Elfstones of Shannara. His latest series -  the Genesis of Shannara Trilogy, made up (so far) of Armageddon's Children (2006) and the recently published The Elves of Cintra (2007), with another book in production, ambitiously links the Shannara series with The Word and the Void series. As if this wasn\u2019t enough, Terry\u2019s has recently been involved in developing work which has been adapted into a graphic novel due next year. Dark Wraith of Shannara will continue the story of Jair and Kimber Boh (from the Wishsong novel.)Though Terry\u2019s writing is clearly very important, his influence in the genre overall must also be mentioned here. Throughout the whole of his writing career, Terry has given support to new writers (like R.A. Salvatore, Greg Keyes, Philip Pullman, Eldon Thompson, and Christopher Paolini) and been an active advocate of the Fantasy genre. His first non-fiction book, titled Sometimes the Magic Works: Lessons from a Writing Life was published in 2003 and gave advice to aspiring writers based on his own experiences. Terry teaches annually at the Maui Writers Conference & Retreat and lectures extensively on writing.Throughout his writing career he has regularly attended conventions, of which Fantasycon 2007 is his latest, and is a very popular convention guest and speaker. He has a reputation for being an approachable and friendly writer with a compassion for fans and a great deal of knowledge of the genre and publishing. He maintains a regular web presence at his website, where he answers fans questions every month. Today he lives in Seattle and Hawaii, with his wife Judine.Writer, nurturer, orator, genre fan \u2013 Terry Brooks embodies many of the strengths of the Fantasy genre today. Without a doubt, his importance in the Fantasy genre is such that without his efforts over the last thirty years, the broad spectrum we call Fantasy would today be a much less interesting and entertaining one. In that context, and from the personal perspective of someone who has been reading Fantasy for over thirty years, Terry\u2019s legacy is supreme.-------------------------------------------------------------------Hobbit","Year":2007},{"username":"Bluestar","date":1190073600000,"title":"Another recommendation thread...","replies":25,"views":3000,"text":"First I'd like to say I'm really sorry for starting another of these thread. But I have a problem. I think I am starting to give up on literature. I've been burned so often from bad books and authors recently, I think I have lost my enthusiasm. I did check out the sticky recommendation thread and clicked on most of the links, but it wasn't enough to help me.A couple of years ago I didn't mind picking up pretty much any book. Sometimes I found a gem and sometimes not, but I was always satisfied. Now... well I can't do that. I can't even get myself to finish a book unless it really really appeal to me. The only way I have found to make sure of that is by being extremely selective and only reading books that I know have my sure-win formula.It's hard to really figure what my recipe for fun is, but here's some things I can think of.The book must have some female main characters. (This is probably the most important criteria)Some sort of romance add to the appeal but it is not 100% necessary if the characters and their interactions are interesting enough.Lots of character development and interaction. This is usually more important to me than the plot itself. If I don't like the characters or find them bland I wont like the story even if it has the best plot ever.Intrigue. It can be political intrigue, it can be the \"supernatural living among us\" kind, it does not really matter, but I like intrigue and \"cloak and dagger\" stuff.I tend to like shades of grey better than black and white, but I'm ok with black and white.I am a pessimist and I get a secret thrill every time things go wrong in the world\/for the characters, but that's not really necessary, it's just bonus points.I posted this in the Fantasy section, but I'd be happy with Science Fiction or even regular literature if it fit these criteria.And to help some more, here's a couple of well known books or series I read and what I thought of them.Wheel of Time: I really really liked the interactions between the characters, especially the Aes Sedai and the Elaine's Throne intrigue.Ice and Fire: Great shades of grey, realistic world with plenty of interesting characters of all sex and age. Plus bad things happen to everyone and I like that.Dresden Files: This series lack many of my criteria, but I saw a few episodes on tv, liked it and read about 4 of the novels in one weekend, since then I'm hooked. It does have the supernatural intrigue which is probably what attracted my attention in the first place.Amber Series: Started nicely, but once the amnesia was over and we knew the setting the story didn't appeal enough to me and I stopped after the third one.Sword of truth: Some people couldn't stand the preaching. What made me stop is that Richard and Khalan get separated in every novel. But I did like the characters.Shannarra: No female lead characters, didn't get through the first novel.Honor Harrington: Interesting lead female character, more realistic space fights. Getting a little repetitive but I'll stay to the end to see her adventures.Ender's Saga: The first novel was interesting enough, but it has none of my criteria and I didn't get into the other novels after the first.Mote in God's Eye: Liked the first novel, but not enough to read the second one.Xanth: I managed to get through the first 2-3 novels but it was getting way too silly and it didn't really appeal to me. Most likely I didn't like the characters enough.Myth Inc. Series: I read the whole thing, don't ask me why. Probably because it was light, entertaining and the books weren't too big.Farseer: I read the first one and found it interesting, but with no real romance or female cast in sight and not liking the direction of the story I couldn't finish the second one.William Gibson: Cyberpunk stuff always appealed to me. I liked his short stories but I never managed to get farther than a chapter or two in Neuromancer.Snow Crash: My second attempt at cyberpunk after having this author recommended. I liked the beginning of the book and even the characters and the setting, but it got weaker and more flawed as the book progressed.Well I'll stop here, but you can see from the books I gave up on what I meant when I said I was losing my enthusiasm with literature. A couple of years ago I would probably have devoured all these books even if they were not perfect to me.

A Dance with Dragons by George RR MartinBook 5 of A Song of Ice and FireETA: Late 2007 (touch wood)Unfortunately delayed from this year, the fifth volume in the fantasy epic brings back all the characters missing from the fourth book, introduces some new ones (for the last time) and, generally, unleashes hell on the Seven Kingdoms.2. Red Seas Under Red Skies by Scott LynchBook 2 of The Gentleman BastardETA: 21 June 2007The Lies of Locke Lamora was the big fantasy debut of 2006 and the already-finished sequel is sparking a lot of pre-publicity hype eight months before publication.3. The Aspect-Emperor: Book One by R. Scott BakkerBook 1 of The Aspect-Emperor (duh)ETA: Very Late 2007 (US\/Canada), May 2008 (UK)The second of the three series that together tell the story of The Second Apocalypse starts in late 2007.

Ysabel by Guy Gavriel KayETA: 5 March 2007Kay's first urban fantasy has already attracted some fantastic reviews. The film adaption of his novel The Lions of Al-Rassan (by the guy who did The Last Samurai and Glory) may also surface, but probably not until the end of 2008.6. The Dreaming Void by Peter F. HamiltonBook 1 of The Void TrilogyETA: September 2007The sequel trilogy to PFH's Commonwealth Saga, picking up 1,200 years after the events of Judas Unchained.7. The Children of Hurin by JRR TolkienETA: 16 April 2007Several different drafts of this story - told in brief form in The Silmarillion - have been combined to give us a huge new Middle-earth tale. One of the highest-profile releases of 2007.8. The Prefect by Alastair ReynoldsETA: 19 April 2007A new stand-alone SF novel in the same universe as his earlier Revelation Space Trilogy.9. Storm of the Dead by Paul KearneyBook 3 of The Sea-BeggarsETA: Late 2007Kearney's excellent nautical epic fantasy continues to its penultimate volume. Hopefully Kearney's earlier, superb Monarchies of God series may be reprinted as well, but probably not until 2008.10. A Sword from Red Ice by JV JonesBook 3 of Sword of ShadowsETA: December 2007The much-delayed penultimate volume of Jones' Sword of Shadows Quartet (itself a sequel series to her earlier Book of Words Trilogy) was finished some months ago, but publishing problems will keep it off the shelves until late next year.Night of Knives by Ian Cameron Esslemont, Making Money by Terry Pratchett and The Sworn Sword by George RR Martin all just fail to make the grade, NoK and TSS because they have been already published in different forms and MM because, well, I'm a bit behind on Pratchett and probably won't catch up before it comes out.The Born Queen by Greg Keyes, the conclusion to his Kingdoms of Thorn and Bone sequence, looks promising for a late 2007 release.

Of all I have read, the top 24 I truly consider the Grand Masters of Speculative Fiction. The \u201cwork\u201d included next to each author is displayed because, (1) I considerate it their best work, (2) I have read it, or (3) it is widely held with the highest regard. The work is not necessarily the sole determinant for the ranking of each author, so there is no comparison being drawn between individual works.  \r\rIn my eyes the four chief ways in which books may please us are language use, plot, setting, and characterization. This is how I set about rating each author, with historical and social importance having minimal effect. \r\rI left Author #1 symbolically anonymous because there is no legitimate way to determine who is the greatest speculative fiction author of all time. He\/she may be among us, lost in history, or yet to write a single word. \r\rHere\u2019s the general order I have compiled, from # 2 (Vance) to # 101 (Martin):\r\r1. ?\r2.

May I say if ever you have a chance to go to one, grab it with both hands. It doesn't matter what you are interested in, there will be something for you. Even sitting in the coffee shop and talking to other people was worthwhile. A writer can learn so much from readers and other writers; a reader can only be stimulated by contact with so many people who have a similar interest... \r\rFor reasons of expense saving, I was staying with my daughter in her tiny Glasgow basement, so I didn\u2019t have the benefit of living on site, so to speak, but never mind. We started the morning in the coffee shop at the entrance to the Interaction concourse and usually met some great people before the programme even started. \r\rAfter that, it was sort out what panels I wanted to get to for the day, but alas, I rarely managed even a quarter of what I intended. They either clashed, or I was waylaid, or dragged off elsewhere\u2026but that was all fun anyway. \r\rThe panel on whether the future of world politics was one of the most memorable. As I remember (and my memory could be faulty) it consisted of Ken McLeod, three Simons of varying political persuasions, John Jarrold and Patrick Nielsen Hayden. It became quite heated. Other panels were simply funny; others informative\u2026as far as I was concerned it all came to an end far too soon. I\u2019m sure the organizers were relieved, though. \r\rAs for my personal part: it started with the reading. The Hobbit turned up (thanks Mark!) and several others I didn\u2019t know \u2013 plus new and old friends to lend some moral support. Someone complained afterwards that what I chose to read had no magic. Ah. The comment took me back a bit, and I didn\u2019t really say much that was sensible to her afterwards! I read from Gilfeather, which is, in part, the story of a pacifist physician confronted with magic and determined to find a logical explanation. In the end his disbelief has consequences that shatter his existence. And yes, there is plenty of magic there! Anyway, I was just so glad to see that there were people in the room\u2026\r\rThe panel I was dreading \u201cIs The Future Non-Western?\u201d  actually went off quite well, although I rather think it didn\u2019t stay on topic. My own feeling is that the sheer size of China, and to a lesser degree India, is what will tip the scales in the future. If every family in China possesses a refrigerator and one car, the world will change irrevocably. It is as simple as that. And I am not sure that reality came across as strongly as it should have done. Anyone wanting to write sf of the future has to be aware of the impact of a giant when he flexes as much as a toe, if indeed they want to write realistic fiction.\r\rFrom an even more personal perspective, I think I benefited as a writer from the networking experience of a Worldcon. I met several publishers and editors. Other writers (and even an Oz bookseller) were mentioning me to UK and US publishers, with the result that one expressed a keen interest in reading my work. The MS of the first volume of The Mirage Makers is now on his desk. So my grateful thanks to my fellow writers who showed the true spirit of the writing fraternity. I also had a three hour lunch with my agent (whom I don't get to meet nearly often enough as she lives in Devon) so that was very satisfying too. \r\rAnd then there was the partying\u2026  \r\r(And in the middle of it all one night, I went to a gig at the Nice 'n' Sleazy in Sauchiehall St where my daughter's band, F.O.

He says:\r\rSlipstream is easy to spot. The protagonist usually spends most of his time wandering round an urban landscape pursuing a dysfunctional sex life while some vaguely weird things happen, just, happen. The piece you will read - I shall not call it a story - starts, runs for a few pages, then stops. There is no real beginning, middle, or end. It is authorial masturbation that leaves the reader thinking, 'Well, what about me?' Raymond Chandler said that when he felt a story was flagging he'd walk in a man with a gun. In slipstream the man remains on the other side of the door, nothing is resolved, and the reader wonders if there ever was anything to resolve. I get a lump of frustration developing in my stomach when I find myself reading one of these pieces and it slowly dawning on me that it is not going to have an ending, that the characters will not have changed and their squalid existence will just ... continue.Click to expand...This statement, to me, is reactionary, conservative and far too generalised.\r\rIn the original article \"Slipstream\" where he coinded the term, Bruce Sterling mentioned authors he considered to write slipstream, including Edward Whittemore, Alasdair Gray, Angela Carter, Michael Moorcock, Iai Banks, Lucius Shepard, among others. I would argue slipstream is not a genre or even a subgenre per se, it's just a shorthand that's developed to refer to work that's cross-genre. Therefore, to tar and feather all cross-genre stories as bad, simply because people label it slipstream, is just plain stupid.\r\rAlthough a lot of the fantasty work I enjoy might be classified as slipstream, I don't particularly like the term. I like to refer to the works many desribe as slipstream as, quite simply, fantasy, and I think it weakens the genre as well as the critical appreciation of fantasy to create other terms and subdivisions.\r\rSo, how do others feel about this?","Year":2004},{"username":"Bond","date":1067817600000,"title":"An Undefined Era?  Post Tolkien Pre Brooks","replies":6,"views":2000,"text":"Maybe it's because I'm merely a fantasy enthusiast and not a fantasy fanatic, but going over the fantasy works I'm most familiar with there seems to be a relatively significant period of time where fantasy in the 20th century seems pretty undefined from which not many fantasy works are commonly remembered.  The period I refer to is that which follows Tolkien and up to about Terry Brooks.  What fantasy was produced during this era? Why is this fantasy period largely forgotten and ignored?   The works that most easily come to mind for me are predominantly the children's oriented ones like The Chronicles of Narnia, The Once and Future King, The Chronicles of Prydain, A Wrinkle in Time although something like Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser (personally haven't read it yet) was made at this time and The Chronicles of Amber slips into the later end of the period as well.  \r\rI notice it coincides with a period for which sci-fi is largely remembered for today.  Did the ascendence of one genre mean a dark period for the other?  Or was it something else?  Was fantasy still in its youth?  Was the generation of writers that was reared on Tolkien, Lewis, Howard and White still young? Was the standard of fantasy writing simply low or unengaging for the majority?  Personally from the little I've read from the time I have to say I don't find the style of the period particularly attractive.  I'd like to know what other people think though.\r\rIt strikes me as strange that fantasy from this relatively long period survives as little more than a memory for only a few even though it is not that long ago.  More people seem to be recalling Dunsany and Howard on these boards than Fritz Lieber and Zelazny who seems to be more well known for his sci-fi anyway.\r\rAn analysis of the fantasy in this period I think would be interesting to understand what exactly has made it (in)significant.  Were fantasy authors too concerned with being literary in their own view that they marginalized themselves?  Why did stuff like Shannara spark interest in fantasy while the stuff produced beforehand largely didn't?  I think the popular fantasy of today and recent past is far richer than some people give it credit for.","Year":2003},{"username":"ezchaos","date":1063843200000,"title":"King Arthur Books","replies":4,"views":792,"text":"Something I've always noticed when I hit the local bookstores is the large amount of fantasy books devoted to the King Arthur legend.

Over the last few months, since winning the award I have had a few offers for it from the usual Indie Press\/Pod sources but decided against them. Anyway, cursed I hear you say. The story is like this: \r\rThe book sold to Tanjen in 98, and then Tanjen folded the week it was supposed to go to press, then it sold to Indigo, who released Steven Climer's Bearwalker - but having seen their first release of Bearwalker, which looked like it had been made on a kitchen table with a dotmatrix printer and a thermal binder, I decided against going with them, and took it to Keith and Rhonda at Gargadillo who accepted it for their fledgling list as a hardcover with illustrations by the awesomely talented Fredrik King. Then of course Keith was taken horribly ill, and they were forced to close their list. DarkTales were looking at doing it, and then they collapsed. It was then picked up by TWO houses in the UK for professional advances, and both folded, Blazon and Paris Books... and sold in Greek Translation to Oxy but the literature line it was due to appear on disappeared... \r\rDo you see a pattern emerging here? \r\rAnyway, I am really really proud of this book. It has been tough watching it come so close and then slip away, and when those POD offers came in I was really tempted... but the truth is with the book selling to a massmarket house in Sweden I was brought up short, it validates my thought that the book has qualities worth putting out there... so, I've decided to take a leap that is going to have a lot of people shaking their heads and yelling oh the vanity... but I am going to be self-publishing it in massmarket format, matte lamination, and including Fredrik King's artwork for the frontispiece and an amazing cover by Robert Sammelin (my graphic novel collaborator).

The article is behind a paywall (LINK if you're interested) but here's a couple of highlights.What about the story we\u2019re telling as a society \u2014 beyond art \u2014 about climate change? Is there a way we could be talking about it that\u2019s more likely to motivate the kind of mobilization we had, say, during the Second World War? The difficulty is that it\u2019s hard to get lots of people to change their minds. The United States did mobilize in a massive way during World War II, but we didn\u2019t start getting serious about it until 1942. There had been a huge war raging since 1939, and the Brits were tearing their hair out waiting for the United States to get more involved, and it wasn\u2019t until Pearl Harbor that there was a tipping point in public opinion that made it possible for America\u2019s political leadership to declare war and to enter into it in a serious way. So the question asks itself: What might be a climate equivalent of Pearl Harbor? We\u2019re already having little regional Pearl Harbors all over the place. We had our heat dome in Seattle over the summer, we had the mega tornado supercell that passed from Arkansas to Kentucky. These little pinprick Pearl Harbor events happen here and there, but it\u2019s difficult to imagine one that would impact an entire country the size of the United States \u2014 if it did, it would be a really bad thing. We don\u2019t want to put ourselves in the position of wishing that something terrible would happen. It\u2019s also natural to assume that the CO2 problem is similar to other air-pollution problems we\u2019ve had before. In the \u201950s, there was a disaster in London because of too much coal smoke in the air, and they cleaned up the air by burning less coal.In the \u201970s, a lot of the smog problem in L.A. was cleaned up by putting catalytic converters on cars andcutting down on hydrocarbon emissions. There\u2019s a similar story around the ozone hole.We\u2019re accustomed to thinking that all we have to do is stop emitting the pollutant, and then nature will clean up the air. But it\u2019s not true in the case of CO2 in the atmosphere. People confuse CO2 emission reduction or elimination with solving the problem. But even if we could stop emitting all CO2, we\u2019d be stuck for hundreds of thousands of years with extremely elevated CO2 levels that nature has no quick way of removing from the air. That\u2019s the key thing that has to be widely understood before we can actually begin envisioning ways to attack the problem. andIs being sufficiently entertaining \u201cJob 1\u201d for you or for all novelists? The novel is a pop-culture medium just like comic books or movies. So when you\u2019re practicing an art form, you generally follow the formal rules of that art form. If you\u2019re going to write a sonnet, it\u2019s going to be 14 lines long. You can choose to write hard-to-read books, like \u201cFinnegans Wake,\u201d let\u2019s say, if that\u2019s what you want to do, and it\u2019s a perfectly defensible choice, but in general telling a readable and enjoyable story is a basic constraint of the form.Thanks, Windy!","Year":2022},{"username":"Rob B","date":1326240000000,"title":"The New and Improved Recommendation - Science Fiction","replies":3,"views":331,"text":"I figured it was time to revamp the Science Fiction recommendation thread to follow a similar method used in the Fantasy Recommendation thread.

His first story was published in 1938, and his final story was published at the end of 1945, eight months after his passing, long enough that it was noted as a posthumous publication. His main career was in the US Navy, and that real-world experience shines through in these stories of the Space Patrol. I\u2019ve been pondering them as I put this collection together, because there is another quality to them that is strikingly obvious to me, and I have been trying to figure out why. They are very, very obviously Golden Age SF stories, particularly as contrasted to pre-Golden Age stories, of which I have been reading quite a few in recent years. Forward:Leaving aside Ray Bradbury\u2019s trenchant quip that the \u201cgolden age\u201d of science fiction is 12 to 14 years old, the Golden Age of American SF is generally held to begin when John W. Campbell took over the editorship of Astounding Stories in 1937. This, virtually always, is noted as the beginning of a sharp increase in the quality of SF stories published. What I have rarely seen, if ever, is a clear delineation of what, exactly, people mean by that. Oh, sure, you can find people who talk about the purple prose of the early stuff, and some if it is definitely guilty of that. But what else got better? Why were these stories so clear to me as to where they fit in SF history? While I won\u2019t concede that the pre-golden age stuff is all bad, and I can argue that what is supposed to be inferior is only so because a different standard is being applied than that to which it was written, there are still qualitative differences I can point to, which I think is what most people are getting at when they discuss the shift to the Golden Age. First, and perhaps most glaringly, while villains exist in the Bullard stories, arguably none of the stories are actually driven by villainy.\u201d\u201cPick a few stories from the first years of Astounding, and you will usually find either a specific arch-villain driving the plot, or else an alien race intent on destroying or displacing humanity. The infamous Hawk Carse stories (which I have collected elsewhere) utterly depend on the Fu Manchu analog, the diabolical Dr. Ku Sui. Without his arch-villainy, there is no story. Ray Cummings\u2019s serialized novel The Exile of Time (which, yes, I have also republished) vanishes without the machinations of its memorable villain, the deformed time-traveling dwarf Tugh. Edmond Hamilton\u2019s contributions to Astounding all tended to have an invading non-human species (\u201c Monsters of Mars\u201d, Astounding, April 1931, memorably featured alligator-headed humanoids, e.g.) intent on repopulating Earth, who had to be defeated by two or three intrepid adventurers. Checking Astounding\u2019s predecessor and main competition in those early years, Hugo Gernsback\u2019s Amazing Stories (as well as its sister publication Wonder Stories), melodramatic villains are also the order of the day.\u201d\u201cE.E. Smith\u2019s Skylark of Space books wouldn\u2019t be nearly as interesting without the villain Duquesne running through them. Philip Francis Nowlan\u2019s Armageddon\u20142419 A.D., which gave Buck Rogers to the world, had its villainous Han (Chinese) invaders (although Killer Kane was an invention of the comic strip). Charles Cloukey\u2019s The Swordsman of Sarvon has a Venus populated by humans in two cities, the good Sarvon, and the evil Cor. Its plot is entirely driven by Cor\u2019s attempt to engulf the Earth in a world war so that Corians can then move in and take over the wreckage that results. The Bullard stories, along with most Golden Age stories, don\u2019t work that way. While there are certainly antagonists, they tend to be less about defeating the antagonist as an individual than about solving the problem of the situation the antagonist has caused or made worse. In \u201cWhite Mutiny\u201d, for example, the antagonist is the ship\u2019s captain, but the problem is that his method of dealing with things on the ship has wrecked morale, and he refuses to change. More drastically, in \u201cThe Bureaucrat\u201d, the last story by internal chronology, there is a massive war going on, but the opposing side isn\u2019t even identified. There isn\u2019t any particular antagonist character, but there is definitely a problem to be solved, and the solution of it is immensely satisfying to read. To be sure, there is a clear, almost mustache-twirling villain in \u201cBullard Reflects\u201d; but his comeuppance is almost incidental. The meat of the story is solving the strategic problem he puts Bullard and his crew into. This Golden Age lack of villains (though not of antagonists, of course) holds for most of Astounding\u2019s stable of authors. Heinlein\u2019s future history stories mostly lack a central villain, instead featuring antagonistic systems, usually social (as in \u201cThe Roads Must Roll\u201d or, in a very different way, Methuselah's Children). Asimov\u2019s Foundation and Robot stories are all puzzles, even when the Mule shows up and wrecks the plan of the Foundation. A.E. van Vogt\u2019s debut story, \u201cBlack Destroyer\u201d, featured a monster, but one who was sympathetic and had goals, not a mere instrument of destruction. Jameson\u2019s stories fit right into the rest on this count.\u201d\u201cIn fact, in most of the stories, Bullard\u2019s main enemy is incompetence; and his task is to use the social machinery already extant to either route around, or to transform, that incompetence. While \u201cthe enemy is incompetence\u201d might almost be the mantra of Campbell-era Astounding, and the valorization of competence is a flag that Campbell\u2019s best author, Robert A. Heinlein, took up and flew proudly in virtually everything that he wrote, that in itself doesn\u2019t mark the Golden Age off as unique. For example, the hero of E.E. Smith\u2019s Spacehounds of the IPC, marooned on a moon of Jupiter and having to fix his partial space ship all by himself, faces a daunting task: All too often a machine or part, the product of many hours of grueling labor, would fail because of the lack of some insignificant thing\u2014some item so common as to be taken for granted in all terrestrial shops, but impossible of fabrication with the means at his disposal. At such times he would set his grim jaw a trifle harder, go back one step farther toward the Stone Age, and begin all over again\u2014to find the necessary raw material or a possible substitute, and then to build the apparatus and machinery necessary to produce the part he required. Smith wasn\u2019t writing comedy. He was seriously presenting his engineer hero as a man who could take umpteen steps back to the stone age, and then re-work his way back up to The Future. (The idea that technological progress is a straight, logical, and obvious path is less a fault of Smith\u2019s than it is a reflection of a time before the idea of emergent order got picked up in mainstream thought, and before James Burke\u2019s Connections, and before the world wide web.) This ideal of the hyper-competent man as a norm is far more common in pre-Golden Age writing than post. Once the golden age hit, competence was still a value, but somewhat more clear-eyed views of it arose. Heinlein spent a career exploring the quirks of competent people. In Waldo, the titular character is a super-genius almost of the pre-Golden Age mold, except that he\u2019s also an arrogant monster who has to learn that he does not know everything, and one of the things he knows least is how to be human. In Coventry, he presents a man who is superbly assured of his own competence who, well, let\u2019s just say he learns better pretty quickly. It is perhaps interesting to note that both Jameson and Heinlein were Navy men who took up writing after the Navy could no longer use their services. Bullard is very competent, but hardly at everything, and he doesn\u2019t see immediate solutions to every problem; he is not a superman, he is just a man who is good at his job, and doesn\u2019t let his self-image interfere with it. Furthermore, his problems tend to be those of dealing with the quirks of individuals\u2019 personalities, rather than purely technological. And perhaps that is the best way to mark off the advent of the Golden Age: characters stepped away from stock \u201ctypes\u201d and became more human, more individual, quirks, foibles, and all. * * *\u201d********************This forward by Jason Fleming is copyright 2020 and is released under the creative commons share-alike 4.0 international license * * * \u201cI have taken the liberty of ordering the stories in this collection slightly differently from the order in which they were published.

I won't compare the books on the list to each other or to any other other works of Science Fiction.  I ask myself, for the kind of book each book is, how well does it achieve its maximum potential within its type?I also consider the following:-Nationality of the author-Publication year and general history of the time.-Occasionally, other literature (non-Science Fiction)I may sometimes make carefully considered changes influenced by the input of other users here.

I can\u2019t quite recall what first piqued my interest, though I would probably have to point to the re-runs of shows like Star Trek and Doctor Who on telly, as well as the far-ahead-of-its-time comic 2000 AD as influences. The whole idea of faraway worlds, alien beings, adventurers boldly going where not very many had gone before always appealed to me. Planets with strange names, sleek and deadly spaceships, futuristic settings and sexy alien girls (the latter of which I would have become more interested in as I grew a little older), to say nothing of a small interest in actual science and astronomy, all helped to push me towards that particular genre.And then, perhaps inevitably, I got into fantasy fiction. I\u2019m fairly sure my first experience of this was the grand-daddy of them all, that classic The Lord of the Rings, but it may have been slightly pre-empted by one of Michael Moorcock\u2019s books, Stormbringer. If not, I read the two of them very close to one another. It was probably a good time to be getting into science-fiction, as the seventies (which was when I grew up) was a time when sci-fi was finally beginning to break out of the restricted audience it had been forced into by adults (\"strictly for kids\") with the likes of Flash Gordon and later Lost in Space, as shows like Star Trek, The Tomorrow People, Planet of the Apes, Logan\u2019s Run and of course Dr. Who all showed that science-fiction could be enjoyed by adults.Yeah, that\u2019s nowhere near true. Most of them were still considered kid\u2019s shows, and few if any were watched by adults. Star Trek was the one to break the mould, attracting not only adult viewers but educated ones - scientists, philosophers, lecturers and engineers among them - who watched the show and then praised it for its realism, its attention to detail, its tackling of real-world issues. Certainly, Star Trek was, if not the first sci-fi show aimed at an adult audience, the first really successful one. Anthology shows like The Twilight Zone and The Outer Limits had of course interested people of all ages, some of the stories better than others, and whole families might sit down to watch either show, but while these shows did tend to present moral arguments through their stories (one off-the-cuff example being the superb \u201cThe Monsters are Due on Maple Street\u201d episode of The Twilight Zone, which not only highlighted the paranoia about communism in America at the time, but also showed how we are all just one step away from reverting to barbarians and turning on each other) they didn\u2019t quite build up the sort of fanatic following that Star Trek did, leading to campaigns for it to be reinstated when it was cancelled after three seasons.But sci-fi is not just on the screen, large or small. Now a multi-billion dollar industry, it began of course with the written word and then progressed with the invention of the wireless to the radio waves, in time making its way onto the silver screen and thence to televisions and into the  homes of millions of people, accepted by the masses to the point now where science-fiction films can be blockbusters just the same as any action, drama or comedy. Sci-fi did not come of age in the twenty-first century, but it\u2019s certainly well established now, and few would regard it any longer as being \u201cjust for kids.\u201dMuch of this change in attitude is owed to huge movies such as the original Star Wars (now called A New Hope, but I\u2019ll always know it as Star Wars, and god help anyone who calls it Star Wars I!) and, close on its heels, the more \u201cmature\u201d and earth-bound Close Encounters of the Third Kind. As movies like these broke all box-office records it was clear that science-fiction as a genre was something people wanted, and not just the kids. Though completely different, the two films mentioned above do hold one common characteristic, prevalent in just about any sci-fi movie or series: they take us away, out of ourselves, away from the everyday and the mundane, to worlds that we can only dream of, that may exist, now or in the future, and where the problems we face in our humdrum lives either don\u2019t matter, are tackled with new insights, or have been eliminated in a perfect society.It\u2019s escapism, and one thing people share is a love of being able to escape the cares and worries of their lives, whether it\u2019s losing themselves in a book, filing into a cinema to watch the latest movie or just vegging out in front of the TV. And nothing helps one escape more than science-fiction.Though sci-fi does demand a small amount of thought or logic on the part of the reader, viewer or listener, fantasy, on the other hand, really doesn\u2019t. The clue is in the name: in science-fiction everything has to be rooted, at least in part, in workable science. So writers have to work to assure and show us that what they propose could work - doesn\u2019t have to work, but it could. Ships can\u2019t generally just fly through space powered by love, for example, and if a planet\u2019s atmosphere is not breathable by humans, then taking off one\u2019s helmet is going to result in a nasty experience. Weapons need to follow the laws of physics, as do most things, unless you\u2019re going through a black hole, in which case all bets are off. Even so, black holes are said to obey certain characteristics of gravity, and must be seen to do so in any story involving them.Fantasy doesn\u2019t suffer from this restriction. In fantasy, literally anything can happen, and there\u2019s no need for explanations. Logic does not have to apply. Science is usually either completely absent or replaced by one, ahem, magic word, which makes everything in fantasy work: magic. Magic can do everything. It can lift whole cities into the sky without any need to explain how it\u2019s done. It can allow people to live to hundreds of years, ignoring logic and the physiology of man. It can let someone read your thoughts, grow to giant proportions or become a midget, turn objects into people and people into objects, or have the sky be purple or green, just because it is. Fantasy fiction demands the most strenuous suspension of disbelief; anything you can imagine can happen, and you can\u2019t question it. As Lucy Lawless once said on The Simpsons, whenever that happens, a wizard did it. It\u2019s the oldest and most overused get-out-of-jail-free card in the business, and it always works.So it stands to reason that fantasy as a genre came first, before such a thing as science, never mind science-fiction, was even thought of. It\u2019s so much easier to write a story when you can just say what you want and your audience or readership will accept that on blind faith, believing you know more about it than they do. Pegasus flies? How? What is the science behind - oh yeah. Right. It\u2019s fantasy. Odysseus meets a Cyclops? How can - oh yeah. Right. Well then, where do these orcs come fr - right.Some fantasy writers, to be fair, do go and have gone to quite some lengths to explain how things occur in their worlds; some refuse to just go for the \u201ca wizard did it\u201d idea, though many do. Some have even merged science with their fantasy worlds - this is usually, though not always, known as science fantasy - and in the likes of steampunk and other speculative fiction, it\u2019s the past, not the future, that\u2019s the setting for the stories. But more of that as we go on. Right now I guess all we can say is that both science-fiction and fantasy are branches of speculative fiction, though always referred to as one or the other. There are, of course, many sub-genres of each, and we\u2019ll be looking at these in due course.What else will be looking at? Well, there'll be a timeline, as that's how I like to do things, and how it's usually best to approach any sort of history project, but I\u2019ll be veering away from it regularly to check out authors, works, worlds, concepts, movies and TV shows, comic books, anything that takes my fancy and that fits in with either of the two genres. On the timeline, I\u2019ll be looking at the origins of both genres and their development across the centuries - in some cases even longer back - and how each has changed, adapted and managed to keep itself relevant in a world where more and more bright things are sparkling and attracting the short-term attention of this motley collection of atoms we call the human race. We\u2019ll see how sci-fi movies have, in the main, moved away from the deeper, often darker themes favoured by fifties, sixties and seventies examples, where such movies were called cerebral and were pretty much only for the hardcore fan, into a more acceptable, widespread and mainstream area where action, romance and drama - and sometimes even horror - often take precedence over the science, if not the fiction.Humour, too, seldom in any of the earlier movies or books, has made inroads into sci-fi and fantasy, creating in the case of the latter a new sub-genre - comic fantasy or humorous fantasy - and allowing both genres to stop always taking themselves too seriously, thus opening themselves up to a wider audience. Increased amounts of sex and violence is what the public seem to want, and sci-fi movies and TV shows oblige, constrained as any other media is to provide what is demanded by its audience. Fantasy, to a slightly less degree, though the paintings of Boris Vallejo would suggest otherwise! Fantasy has more embraced the humour aspect than the sexual one, which is not to say both are not in evidence, but as much fantasy is aimed still predominantly at a younger audience - Buffy, Supernatural, Charmed etc - the sex aspect is not only played down, but usually not really welcome. An exception of course is the obvious, and Game of Thrones made its name on the visceral, brutal violence it brought to the small screen, as well as the - mostly gratuitous and in most cases unnecessary - sex. But both sell, and Game of Thrones pushed both hard no pun intended!), making it one of HBO\u2019s biggest ever moneymakers.Question: will I be covering horror in this history? Answer: some. By its very nature, horror can be fantasy. It isn\u2019t always, of course: the stories of Stephen King, Dean Koontz or Peter Straub aren\u2019t always set in a futuristic or fantasy world, and more often than not are rooted in the real world, our world. This isn\u2019t surprising: horror works best when it seems almost normal, everyday, when the guy standing behind us in the supermarket queue could be planning a grisly murder, or be able to see what we\u2019re thinking, or the woman driving the bus is being told by voices in her head to crash it and kill everyone. Fantasy is fantasy, and while we might enjoy it, we don\u2019t believe it can happen. No elves or goblins are going to accost us on the way to Waitrose, no dragon is going to swoop down from the sky over Manchester, and no mysterious bearded old man with a hint of danger about him is going to knock on our door in the dead of the night. These things don\u2019t, generally, happen.But much of what is written in horror can, or could. We can believe these stories because they seem real, they seem possible. That sort of horror I will be avoiding, as it has nothing really to do with science-fiction or fantasy, and while it is indeed a third branch of that parent, speculative fiction, it doesn\u2019t really concern us here. But horror crosses over into fantasy a lot - stories about vampires, werewolves, fairies, supernatural beings, or stories set in fantasy lands or times - and also occasionally, though not quite as much, into science-fiction. The movie Event Horizon is a good example of this: is it a horror science-fiction film or a science-fiction horror film? It\u2019s probably both, and the likes of that will certainly be covered, as will The Raven, which takes as its subject matter the idea of Edgar Allen Poe being accused of murder.So anywhere that the lines between horror and fantasy - or, less frequently as I said, sci-fi - blur, those examples will be covered. But in the main we\u2019re exploring fantasy and science-fiction here, and this will be the focus of my efforts.INDEXSub-Genres of Science Fiction and FantasyTimeline of Fantasy: 1800 BC - 1000 ADTimeline of Fantasy: 1200 - 1900Timeline of Science Fiction: 1100 BC - 1200 ADWorlds Apart: New Planets to Explore - MarsThe Storytellers: John WyndhamFar Beyond These Castle Walls: The Role of the Castle in FantasyIn the Name of the Race - Peopling Fantasy WorldsNo Time Like the Present.

The previous ambassador has gone silent under unusual circumstances and Mahit's job is to find out what happened to him and why he failed to return home for fifteen years prior and how he has maintained Lsel's independence. Mahit's mission is complicated by a malfunctioning implant containing the memories of her predecessor (fifteen years out of date) and by an internal web of politics within the Empire which threatens to undermine Lsel's position...whilst factions on Lsel itself are interfering with her work from afar.A Memory Called Empire is the debut novel by Arkady Martine and the first part of a loosely-connected duology (a second book, A Desolation Called Peace, will be published in early 2021). It is a far-future, science fiction epic revolving around the Teixcalaanli, a civilisation that fuses cyberpunk technology (though with a proscription against brain implants) and Aztec and Mongol cultural influences.As is always handy when introducing an alien new culture, our POV character is herself an outsider. Mahit hails from a much more practical, pragmatic society based inside a space station, a self-regulating habitat which is totally technology-dependent with no single points of failure. Every time someone dies, their memories and something of their personality are implanted in a successor, who gains access to their lifetime's knowledge and experience and can start building on it. As such every life is inherently important, as it contributes materially to the development of the culture and society as a whole. This is the inverse of Teixcalaanli, where brain implants are seen as anathema and the society is much more inherently conservative: with access to amazing technology which could be used to create entertainment, their primary cultural obsession remains poetry.There's a lot of clever ideas floating around in A Memory Called Empire. The philosophical concept of identity and how it is built from memory and cultural influences is a key part of the text, but one this explored subtly and intelligently throughout. There is also a fair bit of worldbuilding of the Teixcalaanli and their homeworld, which is mostly achieved through plot developments and action. Infodumping is occasional but fortunately rare. Characterisation is strong, as Mahit expertly chooses which sides of herself (and her culture) to show to the Teixcalaanli, and is not above preying on their instinct that she is an uncultured barbarian from a society with nothing to offer.A few people have drawn similarities in tone to Ann Leckie's 2013 debut, Ancillary Justice. I think there are a few such comparisons to be made, mainly down to the idea of a technology-driven identity crises, but A Memory Called Empire is also a stronger book, and in particular it does a much, much better job of laying pipework for a sequel whilst being a complete novel in itself (Ancillary Justice was very much a strong stand-alone somewhat undermined by two lacklustre and unnecessary sequels). I think comparisons to the work of Lois McMaster Bujold and to China Mieville's SF novel Embassytown can also be drawn, with regards to how identity, history and language are interrelated concepts which can define people as individuals and a culture.If I did have one complaint it would be that the ending feels a little neat (I'm not sure if a symbolic gesture would be really enough to get a determined enemy commanding a vastly superior army to surrender) and abrupt, but Martine does enough good work here to make the semi-sequel an immediate buy.A Memory Called Empire (****\u00bd) is a striking debut novel which muses on big questions and wraps them around a compelling story that is part identity crisis and part socio-political thriller.

While watching the trailer I had the strangest feeling come over me seeing the setting of the late 1890s for the show. It is the same feeling I get from works of Alternate History\/Future sci-fi, a feeling I think I derive from seeing typical historical settings or elements repurposed to create bizarre possibilities. It's like watching  Nazis with laser guns (i.e Wolfenstein, Man in the High Castle); it's familiar, but the science fiction elements are augmenting the history in a way that makes it fantastical. The strangest part about this is that War of the Worlds was born from H.G. Well's structure of feeling and cultural consciousness. Something like Stephen Spielberg's take is the actual re-write, but a contemporary production like the new BBC work feels even more like a re-conceptualization even though it remains more faithful to the time period of the source material. The original novel was not a work of alternate history, speaking in terms of genre (even though on a technical level most if not all sci-fi is a form of alternate history), but an expression of the anxieties felt by H.G. Wells and their time period, making the sudden change of perception feel so strange, even to myself. And it's not even something I feel when I think about the book; the setting and story feels natural in text, but it's almost as if the jump to the screen has emphasized the dissonance between the historical and fantastical elements. This wasn't something I felt watching the 1960's movie either, this is something new and I think an indicator of the really interesting ways in which texts and our perceptions of them change through both the passage of time and adaptation. I don't know if this is anything new, but if it isn't at the very least it's an example that makes the evolution of texts abundantly obvious and the ways in which mediums alter meaning, even accidentally.I'm interested to hear your thoughts, and if War of the Worlds has inadvertently become a form of Alternate History sci-fi within our cultural consciousness. I feel like that could be a really interesting meaning that could be emphasized in the new show--that is the tension between history and technology demonstrated by the ways in which authentic representations of the past either blossom or struggle to be maintained in the advent of mechanical\/digital revolutions.","Year":2019},{"username":"Matt H.","date":1559692800000,"title":"SF Classics Reading list - where to start?","replies":2,"views":259,"text":"Just had to chip-in, out of the blue, but only actually read a few excerpts.

Hak Veil used to pilot ships through the blackness between worlds, acting as a highly-trained combat operative. After a few things went wrong, he's wound up abandoned on the Red Planet, trying to find a way of getting back to Earth. His unique abilities allow him to find work in the most unlikely of places and his new job is a doozy: playing bodyguard to a pen-pusher, one of a team sent to audit the colony's finances on behalf of the colonial authorities. But things soon start going south and Veil finds himself on the line, with the promise of a ticket home being the only thing keeping him going...Rewind a decade or so and Richard Morgan was one of the hottest new voices in science fiction. His Takeshi Kovacs trilogy (now a Netflix TV show under the title Altered Carbon) was a vital, angry work of cyberpunk meshed with hard-edged, military SF. Market Forces was a corporate thriller with an SF angle and the even angrier, dirtier Black Man (Thirteen in the US) was a gripping and increasingly prescient story of nations collapsing amidst a tidal wave of rising social discontent.Morgan then took a hard-right turn into the grimmest end of the fantasy genre (albeit SF-tinged) with his Land Fit For Heroes trilogy (The Steel Remains, The Cold Commands, The Dark Defiles), an accomplished work but one where, it turns out, his sensibility was perhaps a little too familiar, with writers like Joe Abercrombie and Mark Lawrence achieving greater success in that end of the market. Morgan's voice and sensibility felt a little redundant in that field at that time, despite his obvious writing chops.Morgan is now back in the field of science fiction and it feels like the return of one of SF's prodigal sons. SF is ready for a new, scintillating book that tears the genre a new one and does fresh, exciting things.Thin Air is not that book. That is not to say that Thin Air is a bad novel, as Morgan's skill with prose, with ideas and with violent action remain undimmed. It is, however, a novel that is not so much in his comfort zone as it is one clad in a Richard Morgan dressing gown and slippers. We once again have an ultra-competent, alpha-male protagonist with near-superhuman technological abilities whom everyone underestimates repeatedly, whom women want to have sex with and men want to have a beer with, who is constantly living on the edge of either death or bankruptcy (despite his clear and unique skillset), who gets in over his head but comes out on top through his superior skills and intelligence and ability to murder literally everyone in a room in seconds. When Morgan did that with Takeshi Kovacs, it was fresh and exciting. When he did that with Carl Marsalis, the racial angle added something fascinating to the mix. When he did that with Ringil, the fact he was an angry and unapologetically gay man made that work. With Hak Veil, it's starting to feel a bit less fresh and a bit more like a retread.It doesn't help that there isn't really a great hook in the story. Mars is being audited and some people are unhappy with that and that's really kind of it. The Martian angle is also not tremendously distinctive either, the odd mention of the weaker gravity and the tall walls of Mariner Valley aside, the book could be taking place in pretty much any SF metropolis on or off Earth. Kim Stanley Robinson's position as the author who has brought Mars vividly to life as its own place better than any other remains unchallenged. Also, most of the characters are distinctly unlikable and the plot makes frequent pit stops for increasingly non-sequitur random sex scenes (rather more than in most of Morgan's prior novels, in fact, including the distinctly late-Heinleinian use of the phrase \"pneumatic breasts\").On the plus side, Morgan's writing crackles with kinetic energy and no-one does a brutal turn of phrase better than him. If this novel is Morgan-by-the-numbers, it at least brings the author's talents as well as his weaknesses. There's some pretty good action set pieces, Veil putting together the clues to the mystery is fun (even if, as with his previous novels, there's zero chance of the reader solving the mystery themselves) and there's a wry sense of humour that occasionally surfaces. Whilst virtually all of the characters are unlikable, they're also mostly at least interesting and well-drawn (the major exception being Veil's stripper neighbour whom he also has a no-strings relationship with) and the novel's finale features an appropriate amount of clever plotting and visceral carnage that makes for an explosive ending to the story, even if the stakes never feel hugely engaging prior to that.Thin Air (***) is a fairly solid Richard Morgan novel. It's far from his best, but certainly readable and it's nice to see him back in the science fiction thriller genre. But it feels like he's capable of far more. Readable, engaging but ultimately perhaps a little too ordinary a novel for an author who should never be ordinary.

The people best-equipped to survive in this world are those who synthesise content for the net: synners. The arrival of sockets, cybernetic implants which allow people to directly interface with computers through their minds, marks a major change in society and technology, and what it means to be human. But when something goes wrong, it falls to one group of synners - outcasts, failures and data junkies - to save society, fix the net...and discover that intelligence itself can be synthesised as well.Synners is the third novel by American SF author Pat Cadigan. Originally released in 1991, it was a late-breaking novel in the cyberpunk movement, championed by the likes of Bruce Sterling, William Gibson and Neil Gaiman. It won the Arthur C. Clarke Award and has been enshrined in the Gollancz SF Masterworks range as one of the all-time defining works of science fiction.Synners is interesting for coming towards the end of the cyberpunk movement, at least before subsequent books like Jeff Noon's Vurt and Richard Morgan's Altered Carbon began taking it in very different directions and the movement was subsumed more into science fiction as a whole. It's also interesting for coming during the earliest days of the internet as we know it, so at least some terminology (laptops, email, virtual reality) rings true, unlikely earlier cyberpunk whose invented terms now feel very dated. Like most cyberpunk authors Cadigan missed mobile phones, but it oddly doesn't feel as archaic in this book. Cadigan is more interested in how technology and being networked impacts on the human condition and the methodology for accessing the net is less important. It is impressive how many other things she got right: satnav systems which actually don't really help anyone get anywhere, hackers uploading viruses to the net just for giggles and self-driving vehicles all feel pretty much on-point at the moment.More impressive is how the novel feels like it's subverting cyberpunk itself. The Los Angeles of Cadigan's future America is, well, pretty much Los Angeles today, maybe slightly bigger and dirtier but certainly not the Los Angeles of Blade Runner. There's nary a mirrorshade or ill-advised superskyscraper (in an earthquake zone!) in sight and cyborg cops smashing down doors and firing massive guns are notable by their absence. But growing corporate power and tech companies acting like they are above the law and pressurising baffled politicians who can't see beyond the next election into giving them carte blanche to do whatever the hell they want without regard for the consequences for society and the economy have never felt more appropriate.Cadigan's prose mixes poetry with hard-edged science fiction descriptions of hardware and software. They are sequences of people immersing themselves in the net and drugs which come across as lucid fever dreams. The novel also delights in the mundane: one of the most important viewpoint characters, Gabe, has marriage problems and a changeable relationship with his daughter, Sam. There is a frustrated air of rebellion in many characters, who take drugs and listen to loud music but no-one really cares any more, certainly not the government which is now wholly in the pocket of corporate interests.Synners has some sins (syns?). The novel is slow to come together, taking a hundred pages to assemble a large cast of viewpoint characters (possibly too many; Gina, Gabe, Sam emerge as the main viewpoints and the novel may have benefited from dropping some of the secondary viewpoints). The scattershot opening makes the world feel grounded and realistic, but the lack of focus makes it hard to work out what's going on. But about a quarter of the way into the book starts to coalesce and the last quarter has the pedal fully to the metal as a global crisis erupts and only our \"heroes\" - the most dysfunctional bunch of hackers and artists you could ever hope to meet - can save the day.Synners (****\u00bd) is a smart and grounded cyberpunk novel that gave the genre a final shakedown, stole its wallet and told it go and do something more interesting.

But while Tristan and his expanding operation master the science and build the technology, they overlook the mercurial\u2014and treacherous\u2014nature of the human heart.Written with the genius, complexity, and innovation that characterize all of Neal Stephenson\u2019s work and steeped with the down-to-earth warmth and humor of Nicole Galland\u2019s storytelling style, this exciting and vividly realized work of science fiction will make you believe in the impossible, and take you to places\u2014and times\u2014beyond imagining\"My Goodreads Review:Assuming you buy its premise and do not throw it away disgusted when it is - close but not quite imho though opinions may differ about that in quite a few places - jumping the shark (among many oddities, the novel contains a viking saga poem in verse cca 930's about the sack of an Walmart (!!) cca 2010's), this is a delight: funny (don't remember when i laughed out loud so many times when reading a book), zany, quite subtle on occasion (while it seems to start in our universe cca early 2010's, there is the Trapezoid rather than the Pentagon for example...) and with a format that adds a lot to the story-line - while most of the narrative is a first person Victorian-style (with modern annotations crossed out) from Melisande (see the blurb) who is marooned in London 1851 and wants to write a memoir and deposit it in a secure vault to arrive in our present and witness the creation of the D.O.D.O. and her role in that, there are narrations in many voices (Rebecca East Oda, descendant of Salem (!!) witches and New England aristocratic matron, whose genius physicist husband Frank Oda former professor at MIT, hounded from academia for alleged mistreatment of cats as in \"the Schrodinger Cat\" experiment, is the brain behind the time-traveling machine at the heart of D.O.D.O, and Grainne, Irish witch\/spy in Elizabeth I England ~1601 are some of the more distinctive voices and powerful characters of the novel), transcripts of official documents (from debriefings after action, email exchanges between characters to the diversity policy of D.O.D.O - this one is a hoot, not to speak of the Halloween dress code official paper), the aforementioned Viking saga in verse and much more.While 750+ pages long, the book ends way too soon (would have loved to read another 700 pages) and has a very useful glossary of the \"alphabet soup\" typical of governmental organizations (most common being D.O.D.O - Department of Diachronic Operations, D.T.A.P - Destination Time and Place, D.E.D.E - Direct Engagement for Diachronic Effect and K.C.W - Known Compliant Witch -) and a cast of characters in the various times and places the novel takes place (both have some spoilers so knowing the main acronyms above is probably enough to avoid needing read it until halfway through the book at least)The ending is excellent in many ways (and has enough closure to make the book a fully satisfying read on its own) though it really reads like a stopping point with more to come in future volumes (which i would highly welcome)Overall - fast, funny, some mind bending stuff and lots of ingenuity, close but not quite jumping the shark on occasion and the top novel of the year for me to date","Year":2017},{"username":"Diosces","date":1497916800000,"title":"Rise and Fall of D.O.D.O","replies":3,"views":280,"text":"Just picked up The Rise and Fall of D.O.D.O at Union Square Barnes & Noble in NYC.

Physicists, stuck overly much in the intellect, aren't necessarily brighter than science fiction writers. It has been reported that Einstein had an IQ of 160. Science fiction writer Brian Herbert reported that his father, science fiction writer Frank Herbert, had an IQ of 190, in his biography about his father. Several years ago, I read the science fiction Dune series of Frank Herbert, all 6 books. Someone I trusted had suggested to me that it was basically a true story. That's what really caught my interest, enough to read all 6 books. As I read the books, I had the impression that I could very well be reading my own past history and the history of other people I knew. As the entire story, all 6 books, encompass a few thousand years in a Time Stream, it also seemed like the characters in the beginning of the story were reincarnated in the middle of the story and at the end of the story. All this suggested to me that many of us 'Earthlings', have already lived physical lifetimes, within the distant future part of this Time Stream, in the distant past. So, there's really no reason to get overexcited about aliens and extraterrestrials. We are them. Some physicists may reject or have a limited view of metaphysics, science fiction writers less so. I'm writing science fiction in which I'll be including the physics and metaphysics view, from my perspective. That includes such things as time travel, reincarnational patterns and parallel universes. I feel I understand these things, not just from an analytical, intellectual viewpoint, but also from an intuitive, synchronistic perspective, like many science fiction writers and readers, using more of the whole mind, apparently. What I've revealed so far, actually goes much deeper. In the mid 1980s, I read the science fiction 10 book dekalogy of L. Ron Hubbard, Mission Earth. Although it was fiction, I had the distinct impression that Hubbard was describing his own personality and the personalities of others he knew, in his characters, including 2 characters which seemed to be describing my personality. Why 2 characters? Because apparently I was involved with Hubbard in my last lifetime also, when I was a British Secret agent and he was an American agent in the U.S. Navy. I psychic friend suggested this to me, as well as the fact that I may have been murdered in 1941. When my friend told me this, I noticed that, I had been writing some of my English words with the British, rather than American spelling, even though I'm from New Jersey, this lifetime. Then I read the book OP JB, by British Secret Agent, Christopher Creighton. OP JB is about Operation James Bond, a British operation near the end of WWII, in which British agents and commandos, secretly parachuted at night into Nazi Germany, in order to extract Martin Bormann, Hitler's personal secretary, give him a new identity and find out from him where all the stolen Nazi loot was hidden. The book also mentioned how the United States got into the war, because of the collusion of Churchill and Roosevelt, about the Japanese fleet headed for Pearl Harbour. Personnel on a Dutch submarine spotted the Japanese fleet and reported it by secret code to the British. The British Secret Agents gave the Dutch submariners a bomb disguised as a Christmas present, sinking the submarine, killing all aboard, in order to get the United States quickly into the war as an ally, at the behest of Churchill and Roosevelt, letting the attack on Pearl Harbor happen, even though they could have easily prevented it. As a British Secret Agent, I would not have supported that agenda. I would have tried my best to find American agents and let them know what was going on, including a young red haired U.S. Fleet officer, whom I had nicknamed 'Flash' Hubbard, because he reminded me of Flash Gordon. My fellow agents would have killed me then, in early December, 1941. In fact, I had a dream recently, in which a man walked into his office of work  and a co-worker pulled out a pistol and shot him through the throat. He stared at his attacker for a minute or so, then turned to walk away, as another co-worker finished him off with a shotgun. It seems like that's how my life ended. It just so happens that in this lifetime, writing a letter to Hubbard, while taking courses in Scientology, I addressed him as 'Flash', because he still somehow reminded me of Flash Gordon. Later, a Scientology staff member revealed to me that 'Flash' actually had been his nickname, possibly the same staff member who also had strangely revealed to me that Hubbard had lived a lifetime in which he had been imprisoned on a certain planet, from which he escaped in a spaceship. By the way, this isn't about extolling or denigrating Hubbard or Scientology. I'm just reporting what happened. By the time I read the 6 book Dune story, decades later, everything came together, including the part about escaping in a spaceship. It seems like Hubbard must have read or knew about the Dune story, realized that it was basically a true story and that he and other people he knew, including myself, are in the story. So, when Hubbard wrote his Mission Earth dekalogy, he was mirroring the Dune series in numerous ways and writing about the same people, but in fictional form. 'Coincidently', Herbert served as a judge in Hubbard's Writer's of the Future contest and they both passed away in 1986. I have other strange connections to Hubbard, some of which may be pertinent here. In 1976 I travelled to Tampa, Florida, from Marietta, Ohio, as a member of the Marietta College crew team, during spring break, to practice rowing on the Hillsborough River and use the facilities at Tampa University. About 10:00 P. M. one night, I was wandering the streets of Tampa, when I saw a building labelled, Church of Scientology, Mission of Tampa. I walked over. The door wasn't locked. I went inside. An older gentleman sitting behind a desk greeted me and asked if he could help me. I said that I was just curious, that I had never heard of Scientology before. He said that he would get help and left the room through a certain door. Eventually, a young dark haired woman entered the same door he had exited and started telling me all about Dianetics and Scientology. I asked her who started all this. She handed me a paperback book by L. Ron Hubbard, with his black and white picture and a blurb about him on the back cover. I said maybe that's the man who greeted me when I came in. She said that's impossible, as there wasn't even a man in the building and no one told her that I was there. Around 1978 or 1979, I read the book, Have You Lived Before This Life?, by L. Ron Hubbard. In the introduction, he wrote that they once had a scientologist who claimed to have been J---- B---- and they found it to be true. Curiously, I had read the book, The Iron Mistress, about J---- B----, in 1970, that I found in my mother's bookcase and had the strange intuitive feeling that I was reading about myself. So, it seemed that I must have known Hubbard in my previous lifetime. It took me decades to get a good idea what it was about, plus a whole lot more. The similarity between the names James Bond and J---- B----, is also interesting. There was a British illustrator of birds named James Bond. The story is that Ian Fleming, the author of James Bond, had a copy of James Bond's birding book on his desk. But was that James Bond a British Secret Agent, at the beginning of the WWII era? Also, J---- B----, had a good friend, John James Audubon, another similar name, who was also a bird illustrator. There seems to be some kind of connection in all this, which I don't yet understand. In March 2011, on the night of what would have been Hubbard's 100th birthday, I had a dream about him, in which he and another man named Marc or Mark, parked their car in my driveway, came into my house and talked with me. Even though the man didn't look like Hubbard, I somehow knew it was his consciousness.  As you are the science fiction people,  this story itself probably seems like science fiction fantasy. But with minds more open then most people, including many physicists and religionists, you should be more open to this and better at deciphering it. You are more open to a better understanding of physics and metaphysics. Not like the demonic individuals who burned me at the stake over 400 years ago, because of my beliefs in reincarnation and cosmology, along with my unwillingness to repent. You see, various intuitive, synchronistic events keep happening, not just with science fiction writers and writing, also with American presidents, the American Civil War, Biblical characters, the Trojan War, certain numbers, including 144, etc., etc., etc. I'm in my 60s. Time to share some of this data. Open your minds even more. Teleportation, time travel, parallel universes and infinite living space is abundantly real. So is the hollow Earth, ancient underground cities like Telos under Mount Shasta, alien and extraterrestrial life and extensive reincarnational patterns and realities. And these things are easy to understand.","Year":2016},{"username":"kennychaffin","date":1471737600000,"title":"Didn't see this yet....Hugo Winners","replies":3,"views":309,"text":"Announced last night.Best Novel (2,903 final ballots, 3695 nominating ballots)The Fifth Season by N.K.

Aesthetically it also sits opposed to the often plain and sterile aesthetics of other futuristic subgenres.A big welcome to:Adam Flynn - is one of the main stewards in the solarpunk movement, having talked about solarpunk in Grist, Hieroglpyh, and ABC.net Australia.

Clarke and also read Dune, 1984 and a bunch of the other \"classics\". Lately though, I've been gravitating more towards Peter F. Hamilton and Richard Morgan - specifically for the combat scenes and space battles. It's hard to describe exactly what I'm looking for, so I'll mention some of the books I've read recently and explain what I like and dislike about them - hopefully that will make it easier for you to give feedback.\r\rFallen Dragon: Liked the 'first encounter' feel of the invasion, the Skins concept, the squad combat scenes and the terrorism theme. Really disliked the romantic plot.\r\rReality Dysfunction + start of Neutronium Alchemist: Good space battles, the jungle combat scenes were cool, the plot was actually very good until the end of first book \/ start of the second where it all just began to feel goofy and lame to me.\r\rFallen Angels + start of Woken Furies: Excellent combat descriptions, liked the plot revolving around Martians  and the gate in Angels. What sort of ruins the entire Kovacs series for me is that the main character comes off as a super douchebag (for lack of a better word). I like superior\/elite type protagonists in general, but Kovacs can't seem to stop talking about how cutting edge and awesome he is. Also, the sexual plots are about as subtle as a sledgehammer to the face, dialogue is often corny (mainly due to Kovacs being a douche and the female characters being severely underdeveloped) and the combat scenes are a bit too few and far between - at least in Angels.\r\rBlindsight: Overall awesome book. Really liked the hard science, first encounter theme, excellent psychological thrills, great philosophical and biological discussions, brilliant use of vampires. No real minuses...a bit light on the combat and too short \r\r\rConsider Phlebas (only read about a quarter in): Main character seems interesting. Universe is a bit too exotic, atmosphere a bit too easygoing for me.\r\rUbik: Original plot, good narration. Again, too easygoing.\r\r\rI guess to summarize I'm looking for novels with a good amount of well-written action\/combat scenes, dark or sinister plot and well-developed characters.\r\rHope this gave you some idea of my preferences.

The climate is wrecked, oil resources have been depleted and the world economy has still not fully recovered from the excesses of the turn of the century. Wade Watts, like millions of other teenagers, escapes the real world by playing in the OASIS, a computer programme that has combined the old Internet and numerous MMORPGs into a virtual reality existence. Five years ago the founder of the OASIS died, leaving his multi-billion-dollar fortune to whoever can solve an elaborate puzzle he left behind in the game. Millions have tried and failed...until Wade stumbles across a key clue. Suddenly a race is on: Wade and several fellow gamers competing with one another and a sinister corporation to be the first to win the prize.\r\rReady Player One is the debut novel by writer Ernest Cline, whose previous genre credit of note was co-writing the 2009 movie Fanboys. Ready Player One, like that movie, is a geek-centric, nostalgia-heavy paean for the past. In this case, Cline references early video games, 'classic' movies of the 1980s and various TV shows and bands as he creates a cultural landscape which Wade must delve into to solve the puzzles left for him and millions of fellow gamers.\r\rThe book is mostly set within the OASIS, with the world outside described fairly perfunctorily. There are allusions to ecological catastrophe, peak oil, climate change and the breakdown of society, but these elements are not developed very far at all. Within the OASIS things are more engaging, with Cline creating worlds dedicated entirely to 1980s video games or to fantastical environments where the rules of nature are twisted. It's basically Second Life meets Tad Williams's Otherworld with a dash of EVE Online and World of WarCraft on top and is described vividly and energetically. However, the creations are usually built on cultural references with Cline contributing little that is original.\r\rThis is Ready Player One's key weakness. The book is a nostalgia-fest, a romp through 1980s video arcades, ancient home consoles, old-skool Dungeons and Dragons campaigns and repeated viewings of movies like Ladyhawke and WarGames. For those who get the references, it's great fun. For those who don't, the book struggles a little. Being born seven years after Cline (and the creator of the OASIS in the book), I got a lot of the references but others, particularly to the very earliest days of home gaming, were unfamiliar. Cline, to his credit, does try to explain each reference in as concise a manner as possible, but this has a tendency to slow down the narrative whilst not necessarily helping very much (my visual imagining of Joust was very different to the reality of the game when I finally looked it up online).\r\rThe characters are straightforward archetypes, veering very little away from the standard. Main character Wade is an awkward, non-confident nerd living with an unsympathetic extended family and being irrationally blamed for their misfortunes (when we get a glimpse of Wade's home life I was half-expecting him to be sleeping a small cupboard, Potter-style). Cline shows a rare burst of imagination in suggesting that in the future, trailer parks will be overcrowded to the point of having trailers stacked on top of one another with supporting framework and these will sometimes collapse, to no-one's particular interest. The other characters are likewise standard: Art3mis is the cute-but-determined geek girl, Aech is the loyal best friend and two supporting Japanese characters are awesome with swords and much-concerned with honour, which is an unfortunate stereotype. There are a few surprises given that we only know these characters through their online avatars and their 'true' selves turn out to be rather different, but again there are few real surprises here. The villains are, well, snarling caricatures of evil whose motivations are unconvincing and whose chief representative, Sorrento, is a laughable cartoon character at best.\r\rSo, we have a book which contributes little of its own to the genre, competently-executed protagonists and awful antagonists. Normally this would be enough to consign a book to the mediocre pile, but Ready Player One still manages to rise above this. Cline's narrative has pace, verve and energy. His ideas are standard but they are handled well, and some of Wade's less laudable activities raise issues about how healthy it is to live your life online or in computer games. Cline is celebrating nostalgia but certainly not advocating dedicating your life to it. The determination of some characters to 'change the world' with the prize money whilst others dream of building a spaceship and escaping also opens an interesting debate about maturity and dealing with consequences rather than running away from them.\r\rPlus, the book is so much damned fun. There's spaceship and mecha fights within the OASIS, antimatter bombings, a puzzle based around the D&D module Tomb of Horrors, a 3D recreation of Monty Python and the Holy Grail and laughs than you can shake a stick at. At one point, as he ascends the levels and achievements of the game, Wade chooses as his vehicle the DeLorean from Back to the Future with a Knight Rider-style front grill and Ghostbusters logos on the side.

With the relative decline of the West and Japan, writers have begun to think about the possibility that the future might belong to Somewhere Else. The most popular choices for that Somewhere Else are countries that are just now on the upswing of their S-curve of economic development: Southeast Asia, Latin America, South Asia, or the Middle East.\r\rGenerally, I approve of this trend (which I will call \u201cNew Exotic\u201d sci-fi). A Venetian sci-fi writer in 1450 (if such existed) would have been prescient if he had imagined the world of 1850 \u201cbelonging\u201d to England, France, or Germany; a British sci-fi writer in 1850 would have been prescient to envision a 1920 in which Japan and America were the \u201cwave of the future.\u201d So it makes heaps of sense for us to postulate that in 50 years, it might be India, or Brazil, or Turkey, or Thailand driving the frontiers of technology and global culture.\r\rBut there is a right way and a wrong way to do this. The right way is to recognize the historical fact that no country reaches the tech frontier without undergoing serious social changes. The faint echoes of samurai and cowboys in the Panasonics and Googles of today are just that \u2013 faint echoes. Writers who realize this will try to preserve some element of the spirit of the old in the form of the (imagined) new, rather than trying to cut-and-paste.\r\rThis is easier to explain with examples.\r\rA prime example of what I consider a successful New Exotic vision is 2009\u2032s blockbuster debut novel, Paolo Bacigalupi\u2019s The Windup Girl. Set in a somewhat-near-future Thailand, The Windup Girl envisions a world where oil has run out, the seas have risen, gene-hacking has run wild, and civilization has declined markedly from its giddy heights (This is a great setup, and very much at the forefront of another movement I like to call the Declinepunk movement, which includes books like Robert Charles Wilson\u2019s Julian Comstock). Thailand, as one of the few nation-states to survive the eco-collapse, is a global leader by default.\r\rBacigalupi\u2019s future Thailand has some marked similarities with the modern version \u2013 the kingdom is still riven by competing rioting factions, for instance. And in some ways, it has retrogressed; the eco-collapse has driven many people toward superstitiousness. But in many ways, Bacigalupi\u2019s Thailand has transcended the shackles of cultural history. Its relative economic success springs from a combination of gene-hacking tech prowess and draconian environmentalism. Its political fault lines are no longer between farmers and city-dwellers (as in the current \u201cred-shirt\/yellow-shirt\u201d split) but between environmentalists and free-traders. Most importantly, people\u2019s prejudices and assumptions and allegiances are driven as much by the memes of the future \u2013 gene-hacking, isolationism, etc. \u2013 as by the tropes of the ancient past (Buddhism, etc.). The characters talk about future stuff as if it has been happening for a long time. That\u2019s change you can believe in, so to speak.\r\rFor an example of a book that I think doesn\u2019t fulfill the potential of New Exotic sci-fi, I\u2019d cite Ian McDonald\u2019s River of Gods, another recent and much-lauded work. Set in 2047 in a politically fragmented India, its vision is more of a traditional Gibsonian cyberpunk one \u2013 AIs, virtual worlds, robots.\r\rThat part is fine. But what annoyed me about River of Gods was that culturally and economically, the India of 2047 looks a lot like the India of 2007 \u2013 or, even worse, like the India of 1977. Caste \u2013 already fading slowly to irrelevance now \u2013 has returned with a vengeance, or is assumed to have never left.. Hindu fundamentalist mobs continue to burn and pogrom Muslim neighborhoods (despite the fact that the last instance of this, in Gujarat in 2002, provoked plenty of reforms and self-conscious national soul-searching). References are made to chai-wallahs serving tea in call centers (in an age of robots and AIs, no less!). The tough, dynastic woman leader of the state of Bharat is a pretty direct copy of Indira Gandhi. Scions of rich Indian families continue to spend their youth in the United Kingdom.\r\rTaken together, this just seems like sloppiness, with dash of old imperial British arrogance. In a future in which India is at the forefront of both artificial intelligence and energy technology, one would expect the culture to have evolved beyond the religiously hidebound, caste-segregated, politically immature society from which the British Empire withdrew in the 20th century. And indeed, visitors to modern India will see that caste, fundamentalism, and old-style politics are slowly fading in importance. It\u2019s a safe bet that 2047 will see an India that Lord Mountbatten would scarcely recognize\u2026but McDonald is not bold enough to envision that India.\r\r(Of course, I should mention that I\u2019m exaggerating the difference between the books. Bacigalupi drops far too many historical references \u2013 the Burmese invasion of Ayutthaya is especially flogged to death \u2013 and McDonald avoids certain old-India relics like arranged marriages. But the difference is there.)\r\rPart of the difference between The Windup Girl and River of Gods is a result of book structure. Bacigalupi has four main points of view; McDonald has nine. Since the books are of comparable length (The Windup Girl is a bit shorter), this means that Bacigalupi has about twice as much page space with which to turn each character into a non-stereotype.\r\rBut part of it \u2013 and this is just my guess \u2013 is that Bacigalupi just knows his subject country a lot better. He has spent quite a bit of time in Thailand; he has seen the battles between the red-shirts and the yellow-shirts up close, he has seen the whorehouses and the foreign carpetbaggers and the monks. He knows the country well enough that he feels comfortable extrapolating how it might change.\r\rMcDonald, on the other hand, has not (to my knowledge) lived in India. And anyway, he has, to date, written sci-fi books set in Africa, India, Brazil, and Turkey; his knowledge of most or all of these places must be limited to what he has read and seen on TV (Bacigalupi\u2019s only other novel is set in his home country, the U.S.). Reading the back cover of Brasyl, I see pretty much exactly what I expect \u2013 the characters are a Catholic priest and a telenovela producer. Yawn. This is travel fiction.\r\rMoral of the story: Limited knowledge of a country\u2019s present will lead to limited extrapolations of its future. If you think Country X is going to be pushing the boundaries in 2050, go live in Country X, meet the people, visit the companies, see the tiny little green shoots of the changes that will engulf it a few decades from now. You won\u2019t get that knowledge from history books or BBC special reports or National Geographic photo spreads.\r\rNew Exotic sci-fi is a cool trend, and one that is hopefully here to stay. But authors need to dream big; the leading countries of the future will bear as much similarity their current selves as America bears to the days of cowboys, wildcat oilmen, and sewing circles.Click to expand...","Year":2010},{"username":"MetalGear_Yoshi","date":1319673600000,"title":"H.

During their colonising efforts, humanity has come into contact with 'Them', a powerful and apparently ruthless alien race. War has raged ever since between the two races, a sixty-year cycle of blood and deadlock.\r\rJakob Douglas is a former British special forces operative dishonourably discharged from the service for organising a mutiny, but still held on the reserve list (thanks to politics). When it appears that an elite alien infiltration unit has breached Earth's defenses and crash-landed near Jakob's home town of Dundee, Jakob's commission is reactivated and he is sent after the creature, triggering a series of events that will have far-reaching consequences for humanity.\r\rVeteran is the debut novel by British author Gavin Smith, and potentially the first in a series (the ending could go either way). This is a fast-paced, action-oriented but sociologically-aware post-apocalyptic, quasi-cyberpunk war story, strongly in the vein of Richard Morgan's Takeshi Kovacs books (Kovacs and Douglas could almost be old war buddies). Veteran, impressively, withstands the Morgan comparison quite well, even if Smith's infectious enthusiasm sometimes overrides his storytelling logic (Earth is simultaneously a technologically-advanced spacefaring world and also a Mad Max-style nuclear wasteland, which seems a bit contradictory). But the book is just so much fun that you don't really end up caring too much that the worldbuilding is a bit shaky in places.\r\rCharacter-wise, this is a first-person story from Douglas' perspective, and he is a reasonable protagonist, even if the cynical, addictive-personality, ex-soldier with impressive resources is fairly cliche by this point. Douglas has some interesting psychological issues stemming from his background experiences, which are gradually revealed through strategically-placed flashbacks throughout the book, making him a more interesting lead. Some of the other characters are likewise fascinating, such as the psychotically angry embedded combat journalist Mudge; Balor, the egotistical pirate king of New York with a disturbing affinity for sharks; and Rannu, a badass but also ultra-cool elite Gurkha trooper. The female lead, Morag, is also intriguing, although Douglas' feelings of condescending protectiveness towards her does reduce her to something of a cypher in his eyes. This is at least deliberate, and resentment of this fuels Morag's later character development in the book.\r\rOn the weaker side, as well as the somewhat inconsistent worldbuilding there is a bit of a Joss Whedon thing going on with the cast of characters getting bigger and bigger as the book proceeds (Smith is ruthless enough to kill a few off, but not as many as you might think) and the focus occasionally dissipates, with some characters vanishing or being present but not contributing anything worthwhile for long periods. There are also a lot of scenes in the second half where the characters sit around debating the plot for long periods rather than getting on with things or giving the reader a bit more credit for being able to figure things out themselves. With another 100 pages or so shaved off the book, it would be much tighter and leaner.\r\rThat said, whilst the overall picture of the worldbuilding is confusing, the individual elements such as the Rigs (a city built out of abandoned oil rigs), Crawling Town (a mobile city of motorhomes, caravans and trucks) and the flooded, abandoned New York City are all vividly described, and there's a constant stream of exciting, well-choreographed battles (in the air, on the ground, inside space elevators, underwater, on the surface of asteroids and more) as well as effective reflections on human nature, the military complex and other issues. Smith, in probably his biggest deviation from the Morgan template, also has a wicked sense of humour and some sequences in the book are genuinely hilarious, whilst he has also nailed the team's snappy dialogue and banter quite well.\r\rVeteran (****) is an accomplished and enjoyable debut SF novel. With some better pacing, Smith could easily rise to the big leagues of modern SF authors quite quickly, and I look forward to his next book.

Meanwhile, investigator Isidore Beautrelet, called in to investigate the murder of a chocolatier, becomes embroiled in shadowy conspiracies and finds himself on the trail of an arch-criminal, a man name le Flambeur...\r\rThe Quantum Thief is the debut novel by Finnish author (but Scottish-resident) Hannu Rajaniemi and has been heavily trailed as 'the' big SF debut novel of the year. These accounts are correct. The Quantum Thief is a crazy joyride through Mars several centuries hence, a world of marching cities, people communicating by sharing memories and a race of hyper-advanced humans who originated as MMORPG guild members. It's the sort of book you'd get if Scott Lynch and Greg Egan teamed up, with the character and black humour approach of the former mixed in with the hardcore physics of the latter. It's at the harder end of hard SF, but is reasonably approachable by those without a degree in quantum entanglement, even if some sort of glossary to distinguish the tzaddiks from the Sobornosts might have been handy for the first few chapters. The opening feels like you're being machine-gunned with concepts and ideas, but once you manage to pause for breath and sort everything out, the story falls into place quite nicely.\r\rDespite the hard scientific concepts being flung around, the book is character-focused with Jean, Mieli and Isidore as the primary protagonists. They are all well-drawn with some depth to them, impressive given that in their world memories and personality traits aren't always what they first appear. The story unfolds briskly (whilst the final layout means that the book will come in at 400 pages, the ARC is a modest 260 pages in length) with barely a pause for breath, the plot is gripping, the ideas complex but thought-provoking, and there are all the requisite shocking revelations and intriguing plot twists you could wish for. The only negative that comes to mind is a late-book revelation that feels like it could be somewhat cheesy, but in execution is actually perfectly acceptable.\r\rThe Quantum Thief is (*****) is a bravura debut novel, a confident and accomplished work that reinvigorates the genre.

Those books (and Halting State) are the only things of Stross' that I've read. So you think he's gone downhill lately? If so, how come?\r\rAs for Mr. Doctorow, again I like some of his short fiction, but his novels seem to me nothing special, very 'for this minute\" ones who will leave no mark in the future, while his online personality is more likely to leave a mark.Click to expand...Huh. I love his novels. The thing I like about them most is their characters. Doctorow portrays geeks incredibly well - their passions, their insecurities, their idealism, their gentleness, their fragile pride. Geeks are a type that seems to have been around forever, and yet I rarely see anyone - even SF authors, who are usually geeks themselves - portray them well. And Doctorow's novels have a warm, human, slightly tragic feeling to them that really tugs at my heart. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I want Doctorow's heroes to win, which is more than I can say of many protagonists (see: any character in a British New Space Opera book). That takes some doing!\r\rAs for the \"for the minute\" nature of what he writes, it is true that a lot of the social issues at the center of his plots will rapidly become old news (sometimes even before the book is published). That doesn't make them bad in my mind - they capture a zeitgeist. Many people love books like The Sun Also Rises, or Catch-22, or The Great Gatsby, or Pride and Prejudice, even though those books were set against social backdrops that vanished quickly. I give Doctorow's books the same latitude. Little Brother captures the paranoia and sense of \"losing America\" that I recall from 2002 and 2003, even if it was published in 2008. Makers captures the feeling of economic insecurity, and smart people's desperate losing battle against those forces (even if the book gets the economics all wrong). These are period pieces, yes, but good period pieces are good books. And some of his books, like Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom, are pretty timeless (that one is about how people would deal psychologically with a post-scarcity world).\r\rAnd as for Doctorow's technology, I find it to be a good blend of the real and the theoretical, kind of a sketchier version of how Neal Stephenson (another of my favorite authors) does things.\r\rAnyway, that's why I lurv Doctorow.","Year":2011},{"username":"JunkMonkey","date":1292630400000,"title":"The Arthur Frayn Memorial 'Every SF Book You Read This Year' thread 2010","replies":39,"views":7000,"text":"Turns out I have read surprisingly little SF this year  - I have read a lot of non-fiction and film related books - so I've padded out my list with all the fantasy \/ near fantasy books too (including the ones I have read to my kids at bedtime.)Battlefield Earth - L Ron Hubbard (Somewhat unfinished).  L'atlantide - Piere Beno\u00eet (e).The Centauri Device - M John Harrison.Mary Poppins - P L TraversThe Star Well - Alexei PanshinThe Thurb Revolution - Alexei Panshin As a break from the relentless ponderous thudding of Battlefield Earth I had a joyous time with a couple of old friends. Panshin's Anthony Villiers books are a delight. Short, witty and annoyingly unfinished. There are three books in, I presume, what was meant to be a long series in which a longer larger story was to develop, the fourth book The Universal Pantograph was never published.  Finn Family Moomintroll - Tove Jansson A Princess of Mars (e) - Edgar Rice Burroughs. It's been years since I read this, and I have fond memories - I must have been eleven or twelve when I first fell for it. My re-read was prompted by watching the bloody dreadful Asylum knockbuster movie version. It's not as good as I remember. In fact it's not very good at all. Edgar Rice Burroughs only seems to have one narrative trick and he uses it at every opportunity. The astounding coincidence. It's incredible. It works like this: our hero, John Carter, disguised as a royal guard, finds himself lost within the vast palace of his enemy. He's looking for his beloved who is held captive somewhere inside its walls. After a few moments wandering around the vast labyrinthine palace he finds her. But she is guarded by four guards. He fights and kills them all, has a brief conversation with his beloved wherein troths are plighted... once various impediments - like the other bloke she has just plighted her troth too - believing our hero to have snuffed it a few chapters earlier - getting killed. But not by our hero because then she couldn't marry him; she's a princess and the Martian code of honour is very particular about this sort of thing. You're not allowed to marry someone if you've killed their fianc\u00e9e. (Seems stupid to me, but there you go.) But it's all right to get someone else to do it. Carter rushes off to find someone else to bump off his rival but decides to wait until nightfall to make his move. But where to hide until then? Aha! He leaps up into a vast ornate light fitting (Martian gravity being so much weaker than Earth's he can leap tall buildings with a single bound - well, short buildings... with a good run up) and waits for night. Some people people come along the corridor, stop just beneath the vast light fitting, and explain to each other in excruciating detail all the plot points, and villainous schemes the author needs to deliver and the means by which Carter can escape from his current predicament to foil them.  And this happens again and again... one astonishing coincidence after another. Everyone he saves from a seemingly inevitable horrible fate turns out to be a prince or some other person in a position of great power able to handsomely reward out hero. At one point, lost in the vast trackless wastes of Mars, flying alone in a one man flyer, he spots a fierce battle below him. Thousands of well-armed (no, make that very well-armed, most of them have six limbs) Martian creatures of various species are beating the living Martian s**t out of each other. Before he can avoid getting involved he is shot down and crashes into the middle of the m\u00eal\u00e9e only to find himself shoulder to shoulder* with the only other sympathetic character who hadn't been mentioned in the last few pages. What are the chances of that then? Eh? I mean.... on the upside it does have some great chapter titles: 'Through Carnage To Joy' being my favourite.  * They might not have been shoulders exactly, the character in question, Tars Tarkas, is green, nine feet tall, has four arms and, apparently, talks like Willem Dafoe. Well he will when the new Pixar movie version comes out.The Way The Future Was - Fred Pohl. A favourite SF writer's autobiography.The Machine of the World - Keith Kisser. Another typo-riddled self-published book. An exercise in proofreading more than anything. Pointless I know but I scribble on books like this the same way some people do crosswords.The World in Reverse - Luan Ranzetta. One of my never to be completed projects that I work on from time to time, when the mood takes me and I have nothing more pressing to do, is compiling an illustrated catalogue of all the covers of the Digit Book imprint of the 50s and 60s. Very occasionally I read one. What a dreadful book. I don't think I have read a book that needlessly and pointlessly switches point of view so often before. Lord of Light - Roger ZelaznyMoominsummer Madness - Tove JanssonMcSweeney's Mammoth Treasury of Thrilling Tales - Ed. Michael ChabonThe Mammoth Book of Best New SF 21 - and that's me out of books with 'mammoth' in the title for a bit. The Greatest Sci-Fi Movies Never Made - David Hughes. A not as good as it should have been, whistle stop tour of SF films that didn't get made in the 70s, 80s and 90s (at least, they hadn't been made a the time the book was published in 2001, several, like Thunderbirds and The Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy, have managed to crawl out of the Hollywood swamp since then). Occasionally informative and sometimes funny. The highlight for me being the unnamed executive who, during a a meeting on the abortive attempt to come up with a workable script for Thunderbirds, wondered aloud if it would be possible to make one of the Tracy brothers black.Destiny Doll - Clifford D Simak. An odd, almost dreamlike novel. Not one of Simak's best but gently peculiar.City - Clifford D Simak. One of those 'Classic' SF books that I found I hadn't actually read before. I was sadly disappointed.Tom's Midnight Garden - by Philippa Pearce. Which is a good book but a bitch to read aloud. Many of the sentences are so stuffed with subordinate clauses and layers of punctuation that I often ended up on the wrong foot half way through them. The ending, even though it was signalled well in advance, presented me with a different reading problem as I was nearly in tears.A Web of Air - Philip ReeveKafka on the Shore - Haruki Murakami. 500 pages of David Lynch by way of Enid Blyton. Back to the crap I think. No Such Things as Dragons - Philip Reeve. Slight but page turning YA novel in which three characters go up a mountain to slay a dragon that they all know isn't there.Eon - Greg Bear. Big blockbuster summer read type SF novel which I remember reading many years ago, with what turns out to have been misplaced fondness. I read it again because I wanted to get up to speed before reading the sequel, Eternity, but I'm not sure I'm going to bother now.The Spiderwick Chronicles (The Field Guide, The Seeing Stone, Lucinda's Secret, The Ironwood Tree, The Wrath of Mulgarath) - Tony DiTerlizzi and Holly Black. A masterpiece of packaging which stretched a novel over five well produced well-illustrated but really very short books. The kids loved them.The Borrowers - Mary Norton - bedtime read for my youngest.Slapstick - Kurt VonnegutA Heritage of Stars - Clifford D Simak. A very late Simak, and not very good.The Ladies of Grace Adieu - Susanna ClarkeThe Other Side of the Sky - Arthur C Clarke. Short stories. A couple nicely done but most are very dated and very pedestrian in delivery.The Best From Fantasy and Science Fiction No.13 - ed. Avram Davidson The Sword in the Stone - T H White The Solaris Book of New Science Fiction Vol. 2 - A modern (2008) collection of new SF which could have done with much firmer hand on the editorial tiller. The final story though, 'Point of Contact' by Dan Abnett, is a cracker and has entered any 100 top SF short stories list I might draw up.Dark Tales of Time and Space - Sean Wright (an erstwhile member of this forum).  Candidate for the worst book I have read this year by far. Flash Gordon Book Three: Crisis on Citadel ll - author not given. Ding! Grade A+ shite in which mighty Flash Gordon: Ahhhhhh! Saviour of the Universe! is reduced by the power of crappy writing to a self-doubting, ineffectual inaction hero who gets knocked out with remarkable ease (at least four times during this book) which sometimes leads to the other characters having to explain to him when he wakes up what has happened while he's been unconscious. This also includes the climactic space battle in which a whole planet-destroying fleet of super spaceships is blown to subatomic particles just in the nick of time. I can only suppose it saved the author the trouble of having to describe it.The Rings of Tantalus - Edmund Cooper. Hard to believe but even in 1975 you could get away with having black characters, even super-scientist action hero types doing 'Uncle Tom' voices (\"Here come de US cavalry!\") and being casually referred to as a 'black bastard' by a friend and colleague. And the second book in a row to have the explosive climax explained after the event to the hero who missed it due to having been whacked unconscious by a lazy writer.","Year":2010},{"username":"halohand","date":1138233600000,"title":"Looking for two books","replies":39,"views":7000,"text":"Hi all,\r\rI'm looking for 2 books that I never finished reading and I don't remember much about them but here goes - \r\rPost Apocalyptic(I believe) world where there is a fence that the people cannot cross because the outside world is diseased and destroyed.

The 'proper' version will have them!Part 1: Fantasy & HorrorPart 2: SFPart 3: Genre Film & TVSo here we are again: our usual review of the year. (This is something like our eighth, I think!)  The snow\u2019s deep around Hobbit Towers but you\u2019re welcome to pull up a chair near the fire while we chat.For the uninitiated, this is where Rob Bedford and I try to pull together what we see as key genre books from the previous twelve months. I should really point out before we start that there is always some slippage here, as books get published in different places around the world at different times. Putting it simply, some books may reappear even though they were mentioned previously. At the moment this seems to be a \u2018UK first, US later\u2019 thing, but by no means always.    At the end, Rob and I will try and mention our year\u2019s favourites. We try and limit it to five each, but it doesn\u2019t always happen that way. Right: with that over, let\u2019s get started.Part 2: SFAccording to Locus Magazine there have (at least up to the point of writing this in December 2010) been 159 SF novels published this year, of which 60 were stand-alone and 99 either sequels or part of ongoing series. That is still quite impressive (though rather dwarfed by the 335 Fantasy and Horror novels.)January started relatively quietly, with the publication of Galileo\u2019s Dream by Kim Stanley Robinson: at times a history novel but with added science; Rob thought the premise interesting, but had difficulty finishing the book. (The book was published in the UK in August 2009.) Dan reviewed Connie Willis\u2019 Black Out, the first part of her split book this year, of which more later. (Mark caught up with it later in the year.)In February, Dan liked The Quiet War, Paul J. MacAuley\u2019s first part of his latest Space Opera. The second part of this tale, Gardens of the Sun, was released in the UK in August. This is where McAuley does big Space Opera, stretching across the solar system. Some felt it started rather slowly but once it got going it was impressive.In March we saw the concluding volume in David Louis Edelman\u2019s Jump 225 trilogy, Geosynchron, which Rob really liked. Alastair Reynolds\u2019 slightly delayed Terminal World appeared, and many seemed to appreciate it also, with its mix of steampunkery and \u2013 dare we say it \u2013 Wolfe-ean fantasy SF. March also saw a Ray Bradbury collection by Subterranean Press. Called A Pleasure to Burn (based on a phrase from the Fahrenheit 451 novel) it was a collection of Fahrenheit 451 stories, some well known, some obscure. Dmitri Glukhovsky\u2019s METRO 2033, set in a future Moscow, also had some interest, as well as being the source material for a simultaneously released game.  April saw Adam Roberts\u2019 New Model Army: though a little too forced for Mark, there were resonances with Cory Doctorow\u2019s latest YA series (see May). Mike Cobley\u2019s The Orphaned Worlds, the second book in his Humanity\u2019s Fire series, appeared. A Mighty Fortress, the fourth book in David Weber\u2019s increasingly popular Safehold series was released this month, debuting at the #9 spot on the NY Times Bestseller list and to a great deal of positive buzz.  Rob is a big fan of this series, but has only made it to the third book thus far.In May, having mentioned it in April, Cory Doctorow\u2019s For the Win was released and seemed popular. Stephen Baxter\u2019s sequel to Flood, Ark, was also released in the US and was felt to be more SF-nal than Flood, being mainly set in space. Ian Whates\u2019 The Noise Within was a solid SF release from Solaris.June saw the \u2018Mike Ashley The Mammoth Book of Mindblowing SF debacle\u2019 which had great stories but no women authors, an issue which upset a few on the interwebs. At SFFWorld, less controversially, Mark liked David J Williams\u2019 second novel in the Autumn Rain series, The Burning Skies with a cracking cliff-hanger ending.Whilst we\u2019re talking of cliff-hanger endings, Mark also caught up with the first part of Connie Willis\u2019s Black Out, which Dan reviewed earlier in the year. He liked it, but then he has been a Willis fan for years.Rob claimed that Ian Tregillis\u2019 debut alternate history novel Bitter Seeds was likely to be \u2018very close to the top of my best of 2010 list.\u2019 (Guess we\u2019ll see that later.) Magic, superheroes, alternate history, and SF mixed together in a tasty blend.July saw the release of Charles Stross\u2019 latest in the Laundry series, The Fuller Memorandum, which was as witty and as full of the usual mind-bending trickeries as any of the previous Bob Howard tales.  Mark reviewed and liked it. The release of Ian McDonald\u2019s The Dervish House in August, set in Istanbul in 2027, was also well received this month. It was released in the US (by Pyr) and in the UK (by Gollancz.) Also in the same month was the UK release of Chris Wooding\u2019s second Ketty Jay Tale, Black Lung Captain. Mark thought it was brilliant: \u2018If you\u2019re thrilled by tales of betrayal and revenge, space pirates, incredibly fast spaceship chases, great character repartee and steam punk sensibilities... this one is a great read.\u2019 It also allowed us at SFFWorld to create, with Chris, the term \u2018bucklepunk\u2019. Rob is looking forward to these books coming to the US in the summer of 2011.Neal Asher\u2019s latest Polity novel, The Technician, was released in the UK and was liked for its usual Asher action and violence.On the non-fiction side of SF, August saw the arrival of Volume One of Tor\u2019s authorised biography of Robert Heinlein by William H. Patterson, Jr., Robert A. Heinlein: In Dialogue with His Century: Volume 1 (1907-1948): Learning Curve. Whilst hardly unbiased, (Patterson being the Founder of the Heinlein Journal in 1997 and a consultant with the Heinlein Trust), and questioned by some on some of its facts,  it was a fulsome account of the extremely private Robert\u2019s early life. The second volume is due out in 2011. We also saw Tor in the same month place posts from lots of SF authors who told of the importance of Heinlein in their formative years. September\u2019s joint Hugo win at the Australian Worldcon, for China Mieville\u2019s The City and the City and Paolo Bacigalupi\u2019s The Windup Girl, caused a bit of a stir, as it\u2019s not too often there are joint winners (the last time was in 1993.) The general feeling was that they were both worthy winners, (though the UK had to wait until December of this year to be able to read The Windup Girl!) Paolo\u2019s Young Adult novel, Ship Breaker, was released in August. Furthermore in September, Peter Hamilton\u2019s Evolutionary Void, the third in the latest series of hefty doorstops, was released in the UK and the US to generally positive reviews. We were also pleased that the US had an almost simultaneous release, as they caught up with one of the UK\u2019s best-sellers for years. Similarly, Iain M Banks also had some of his earlier Culture books released in the US, perhaps in preparation for the release of Surface Detail later in the year.  Consider Phlebas and The Player of Games were both released in March, Use of Weapons and Look to Windward in August.In the UK the re-release of the hefty Helliconia omnibus by Brian Aldiss allowed Mark to reassess his opinion of the books twenty-five years on. The release in September of The Quantum Thief by Hannu Rajaniemi seemed to cause a stir. Many felt that this debut novel was quite special: Charles Stross, for one, was quite impressed. We suspect it will be seen in next year\u2019s Award lists and discussed again in this review in 2011 when it publishes in the US. William Gibson\u2019s Zero History was also released: less SF-nal and more contemporary than many of his previous works, but still often liked.Similarly, October\u2019s publication of Charles Yu\u2019s How to Live Safely in a Science Fictional Universe seems to have both impressed and bemused readers. For similar reasons as above, we suspect it will also be seen in next year\u2019s Award lists.   Cherie Priest\u2019s Dreadnought seemed to be a popular steampunk novel in a popular genre. What with this and Scott Westerfield\u2019s Behemoth this month, the visibility of steampunk was noticeable. It was also reflected in the September edition of Locus Magazine being dedicated to the subgenre. David Weber\u2019s Out of the Dark, an intriguing mix of SF, vampires and aliens (first encountered in George RR Martin and Gardner Dozois\u2019 excellent story collection, Warriors, in March) seemed to keep many of his fans happy, despite not being an Honor Harrington or Safehold novel. November was the UK and US release of Iain M Banks\u2019 Surface Detail, which was generally well received and seen by some as a return to form. Mark liked it anyway: lots of big Banksian ideas and cool characters in a hefty yet entertaining tome. Greg Bear\u2019s Hull Zero Three was released in the US and was seen as a return to form by some. Orson Scott Card\u2019s time travel novel, Pathfinder, was also released.  Tor re-released the first of George RR Martin\u2019s Wild Cards series, after being very hard to get since about 1993.December saw us review McMaster Bujold\u2019s Cryoburn: a welcome return to Miles Vorkosigan, though for Mark, sadly, a rather underwhelming one. More impressive to him was the second part of Connie Willis\u2019 All Clear, which despite its overworked plot in places, was a very satisfying conclusion. The UK also had the release of Paolo Bacigalupi\u2019s The Windup Girl (at last!) which seemed to show them what everyone else had mentioned when released in the US in 2009: nice worldbuilding, reasonable plot, concern about whether the sex in it was appropriate or exploitative. (Rob reviewed it in October 2009.)Continuing our steampunk theme through the year, Ann VanderMeer & Jeff VanderMeer\u2019s Steampunk Reloaded collection was released by Tachyon Press. Subterranean Press released The Best of Larry Niven, a large tome which gave nothing new, yet Mark enjoyed revisiting.To finish the year, Rob reviewed The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. A \u2018post-apocalyptic, dystopic future\u2019 in a YA novel, this has been quite popular this year. The sequels, Catching Fire and Mockingjay are also available. Art reviewed another George RR Martin\/Gardner Dozois collection, The Songs of the Dying Earth, a collection of stories written as a tribute to Jack Vance\u2019s original tales first started in the 1950\u2019s.Mark: Once again, though there is less SF about than Fantasy, I felt that the SF was for me, at least, stronger.  If I had to narrow my ten favourite books of 2010 to five, the majority would be SF.Mark\u2019s favourite five SF of the year, in no particular order:Paolo Bacigalupi\u2019s The Windup GirlIain M Banks\u2019 Culture novel Surface DetailPeter Hamilton\u2019s Evolutionary VoidChris Wooding\u2019s Black Lung Captain (Go bucklepunk!)Connie Willis\u2019 Black Out\/All Clear Heads up also for a great series of reissues this year: Helliconia has been already mentioned, but also H G Wells\u2019 The Food of the Gods, Jack Finney\u2019s The Body Snatchers, M J Engh\u2019s shocking Arslan, and Greg Bear\u2019s Forge of God.

I had a chance to speak with Chris Stevenson, author of \"Planet Janitor: Custodian of the Stars\" regarding his inspirations, favorite SF books\/authors and challenges he has encountered over his writing career. \r\rCheck out a quick synopsis of this space-themed SF book here! http:\/\/planetjanitor.com\/About.html\r\rWhich of the characters do you relate with the most with in Planet Janitor, and why?\r \rI think I have a similar personality to Zaz, the captain. Only because I understand his doubts and insecurities when it comes to love and responsibility. He always wants to do the right thing, but hesitates or battles with inner demons. He\u2019s on a shy side but strong side. My occupations and physical stature mirror Galoot\u2019s, although I\u2019m not quite that big. Like him, I lived my life as a rough and tumble mechanic, then landed a Federal security position.\r\rWhat are some of the influences you had that inspired you while writing Planet Janitor?\r \rThe late great Poul Anderson and Alan Dean Foster were my motivations for writing science fiction in the first place. I still contact Alan Dean Foster and remind him that it was all his fault.\r\rThe controversy surrounding space debris\/junk is an innovative and thought-provoking concept for a book. How did you come up with the idea surrounding Planet Janitor? Are you passionate about any other environmental issues?\r \rTrash in space just upsets me. We're so far removed from it that we hardly give it a moment's thought. By reclaiming the precious metals that compose the construction of our wayward satellites and rocket parts, we can make a profit from the titanium, gold, silver, aluminum and other metals, while cleaning up the atmosphere at the same time. We are a space-venturing race, whether we like it or not. We'll have to clean up that backyard eventually if we are to continue in our space exploration pursuits.\r\rIt must be surreal to see your characters as illustrations after visualizing them in your mind. Who did you choose to prepare these illustrations? Are these portrayals as you envisioned they would be in your mind? \r \rTwo artists were involved, to my knowledge. The first prints that I had the pleasure of seeing, astounded me. The representations were so dead on that I thought all the artists had somehow channeled me. Of course they had all read the book. But no one comes that's close in a first pass. It was mind-numbing how they got all the details so consistent and accurate. Galoot and Carybell, for example, are dead ringers.\r\rIf you had a chance to become a member of a real life Planet Janitor Corporation, would you join a similar environmental clean-up based mission?\r\rI would go if I were single, especially if I knew Dendy was going. If I were married, I would talk my wife and kids into accompanying me on the long ride.\r\rDid you encounter any challenges while writing Planet Janitor? What did you learn from these hardships?\r \rI wanted some hard science in the book. The physics were daunting, once I got started trying to describe the preparation of a ship and a very realistic flight that lasts 26 years. None of this warp drive business, where you use hocus pocus to slap a crew on a planet without explaining how they got there. The mechanic in me came out. I used a nuclear bang drive in a slightly different application, but that bang drive has been proposed by some NASA affiliates, only they describe a large chute that catches the explosion force that propels the craft. I ran into huge problems when trying to cover how many light years or miles it takes to slow a craft with a hydrogen drive, how to sling shot around a moon and how to get the biology right on a new planet. When it doubt, I glossed--it was not required of me to explain everything.\r\rYou've published several books so far, in a variety of genres. Everything from fantasy, to thrillers to paranormal works and science-fiction titles. Do you prefer writing a specific genre? Why or why not?\r \rI'll always be a science fiction writer at heart. Future worlds, dystopian environments, robots and alien life forms have always intrigued me. The masters of sf and fantasy have taken the slots, and it's incredibly hard to publish in that genre. I backed off of it. The rest of my books have been happy experiments, using some magic and time travel. I'm the last person on this Earth that will ever write contemporary literature, although some people have tried to goad me into it.\r\rWhat do you think makes a good SF story? Do you have a favorite SF author?\r \rPoul Anderson, Alan Dean Foster, Phillip K. Dick and Bob Heinlein, most of them masters of the Golden Age always appealed to me. Simple stories, plot driven with a lot of adventure and discovery. Poul Anderson's Virgin Planet blew me away, a small insignificant book that disappeared into obscurity. A reader will see reflections of Heinlein's Starship Troopers in the major attack that happens in Planet Janitor, plus a little bit of simple world building and topography snatched from Foster.\r\rDo you have a favorite SF character of all time (from a film or book?)\r \rThat would have to be Sigourney Weaver's portrayal in Alien. Just a top notch female MC that has leadership qualities combined with common sense and a true-grit attitude. She's no nonsense when it comes to taking care of business. She's got that tender side, when dealing with the distressed orphan. She's a fighter to the bitter end, and a winner.\r\rWhat was the funniest or strangest moment you've experienced in your writing career?\r \rOh, that was when I was accepted by the Richard Curtis Agency, and then sent my first book out to Director John Badham, and the Cohen Brothers (producers), who loved the book. For a SF book that had robotic piloted dinosaurs that fight to the death in arena, yeah, I found that awfully damn strange. Wonderful but totally out there, you know? The dream of seeing Dinothon come to the screen blew up in a puff of smoke three weeks later when it was announced that Michael Crichton's Jurassic Park was slated for a Steven Spielburg film. Dinothon was deemed too similar to JP, and was wiped from the Hollywood slates. Dinothon never sold after that, and I eventually lost the story in a house fire.    \r\rAs a child, what did you foresee yourself doing when you were an adult? Have you always wanted to be a writer?\r \rWriting was an accident. I read my first sf novel when I was 26, and announced to my friends or anybody who would listen, that I could write such stories with ease. I did break into the sf magazine markets, which allowed me access to the SFWA. But, here I am 40 years later still trying to make that big score.\r\rWhat would you say is your interesting writing quirk or habit?\r \rI can't stand changing word processing programs. I'm computer illiterate all the way. Too many buttons, bars and windows for me, so I'm a creature of habit. I'm totally freaked out if my internet goes off--I'm lost without it, and suffer relentless anxiety attacks and sleep disorders if I can't get online. I write copious notes that I never use. I feel jinxed if my screen saver or wall paper doesn't reflect the type of book I'm writing at the time.  \r\rDo you commonly hear from your readers? What kind of things do they say?\r \rI don't have a ton of readers, yet that is. I do get really great, astounding reviews from people I don't know. I love comparisons and I've had a few of those. I've been compared to Stephen King and Roald Dahl, and I'm deserving of neither of those comparisons. Lately it's been Heinlein and Farmer (for PJ). My YA fantasy, Gate Walker has sold quite a few e-copies, and the reviews have all been four and five star. I never, for one minute, thought that Gate Walker was a young adult novel. Apparently I'm wrong, and that was a big surprise.","Year":2011},{"username":"nquixote","date":1292284800000,"title":"Thoughts on the Lensman series","replies":4,"views":1000,"text":"Just finished the Lensman series. Quite good, if you like retrofuturism (as I do). \r\r\r\rYou can really see the transition from pre-WW2 to post-WW2 American values - Doc Smith upholds concepts like democracy, sexual equality, and non-racism in principle, but he can't quite imagine how those concepts would really be implemented in society. \r\rIn one book, for example, he claims that the fundamental principle of civilization is \"equality of the sexes,\" even though the sexes are obviously massively unequal in the future he depicts. But it seems as if, after nominally committing himself to this principle, he starts forcing himself to follow it to its logical conclusion, and he starts groping around for ways to depict a society in which the genders really are equal. He portrays a woman doing a man's job (the most important job in the universe, no less), even though her husband pressures into doing it, and even though she at first denigrates her own capabilities. And when the human race is superseded by the superhuman \"children of the lens\", those children are not only mostly female, but explicitly reject all feminine stereotypes. It's as if Smith realizes that gender stereotypes will at some point have to go if \"equality of the sexes\" is going to be more than just lip service.\r\rSimilarly, Smith doesn't really understand democracy, since only Lensmen are allowed to hold public office, and since political parties sometimes settle their differences with force. But at the end of Second Stage Lensman, he depicts a society undergoing a transition to democracy, and the depiction isn't half bad. And he repeats again and again the insight that infighting is the downfall of autocracies.\r\rAs for racism, Smith obviously subscribes to the racist bias of his time, since all the heroes are (explicitly) Caucasian. But his nonhuman lensmen are referred to as \"men,\" and he explicitly describes the comradeship and equality between all sentient beings. This is the kind of thinking that, after World War 2, has led to the gradual downfall of racist thinking.\r\rHaving lived in a society in which old ideas of sexism, racism, and autocracy were never explicitly discredited (Japan), I have come to believe that real social progress depends on people like E.E. Doc Smith - people whose logic and rationality impels them to commit to moral principles that their cultural conditioning won't let them fully embrace. A society in which the conservative elite voluntarily surrenders power will progress farther and faster than one in which the old guard has to die off for progress to be achieved. Doc Smith was a poster boy for old-style conservative values, but he and his generation helped America cast off those same values.\r\rAs a side note, the Lensman series is clearly the mother of all space operas, and I didn't know this until I read it. From the Foundation series to Star Wars to Babylon 5 to Peter F. Hamilton and Vernor Vinge, there are few space operas out there that do not draw many of their concepts from Doc Smith's masterpiece. \r\rTo sum up, if you like old stuff and epic stuff, and if you want to see where space opera began, the Lensman series is a must-read.","Year":2010},{"username":"Hobbit","date":1289606400000,"title":"Best SF novels of the last 40 years?","replies":18,"views":1000,"text":"Hi all.\r\rSo I'm at Novacon, and meeting Brian Aldiss and Iain M Banks and Ken MacLeod and a host of others (it is tough sometimes!   ).\r\rIt is their 40th convention: the longest continuous SF Con in the UK (I think!)\r\rAs expected, what has been asked is 'What are the Best SF novels since they started, in 1971?\r\rObviously we could do the general debate of 'What is Sf?' and 'What do we mean by 'best'?', but I thought I'd ask for your thoughts.\r\rMy choices (Though I bet I've forgotten something really obvious!) are:\r\r1971Ringworld Larry Niven (Hugo Winner)\r1971Tao Zero  Poul Anderson\r1985NeuromancerWilliam Gibson\r1990 Hyperion Dan Simmons\r1993 Domesday Book Connie Willis\r1993Red MarsKim Stanley Robinson\r1996 Stephen Baxter Voyage or The Time Ships (closest to Arthur C Clarke these days!)\r\rI'm also thinking something by Peter Hamilton, Scalzi, Stross, Iain M Banks\rand more recently possibly Rainbow's End, Windup Girl and\/or City and the City.\r\rBut I'm digressing.

Bharat, with its capital at Varanasi, is on the verge of war with Delhi-led Awadh over water shortages \u2014 the monsoon has failed \u2014 while the Bengalis are trying to change the weather by towing a giant iceberg into the Bay of Bengal. Men vastly outnumber women due to selective abortion. And artificial intelligences are controlled by treaty. But in other ways surprisingly little has changed: Hindu nationalists are orchestrating street protests, capitals still display a vast disparity in wealth between old city slums and gleaming new cities, Western backpackers visit India for the usual reasons, and so forth.\r\rIn this setting, River of Gods follows some nine characters: a gangster who finds his usual line of business made redundant by technology; a Krishna cop, hunting rogue AIs, and his neglected wife, who becomes involved with her gardener; two American scientists, one of them co-opted by law enforcement to find the other, who has gone underground in south India; an asexual \"nute\" working in television production; a young reporter who bites off more than she can chew; the Muslim adviser to the prime minister of Bharat; and a comedian who inherits a third of a power company when his father retires to become a sadhu.\r\rAll of this is rather disconnected, with sprawling subplots and devices pulled out of a hat as special effects: technologies are described that have no significant role in the story and the Indian culture vignettes are largely decorative.

Le Guin's A Wizard Of Earthsea where a black shadow is summoned by Ged, or Sparrowhawk, the trainee wizard. He summons this spirit in pride and in hate, urged on by his juvenile associates. He is told:\r\r'You summoned a spirit from the dead, but with it came one of the powers of Unlife. Uncalled it came from a place where there are no names. Evil, it wills to work evil through you... It is the shadow of your arrogance, the shadow of your ignorance, the shadow you cast. Has a shadow a name?'\r\rWhere did this shadow come from?\r\r'Then the sallow oval between Ged's arms grew bright. It widened and spread, a rent in the darkness of earth and night, a ripping open of the fabric of the world. Through it blazed a terrible brightness. And through the bright mishapen breach clambered something like a clot of black shadow...'\r\rFor millennia human beings have imagined the environment of death to be an actual land, as real as Wales, and possibly as gloomy. Le Guin casts her own glamour over her depiction of the dark side, but it is essentially the same as the prehistoric depiction. Certain concepts are foundations: spirit or soul; life after death; a land in which the dead live, separated from us by ethereal, yet muscular boundaries; the possibility of communication between the two sides. Yet are these concepts rooted in reality? Are they in fact simple illusions created by humans beings who lacked objective knowledge of the world?\r\rYou and I may consider the notion of life after death, of spirit, of soul, to be ludicrous. How easy it is for us to conclude that ancient people could not bear, let alone understand, the business of dying, and so created illusions with which to assuage their distress. But we must not laugh just yet at the religious, in case they have a point.\r\rMy aim in writing this article is to see if writers of speculative fiction have been able to create new metaphors of death. I myself have no belief in the existence of an afterlife. I hope my body will rot into organic goodness after I die. Nor do I have belief in spirit or soul. The word spirit is derived from the Latin spiritus, 'breath, spirit', from spirare, 'breathe'. It is clear from this derivation alone that ancient people considered themselves owners of an immaterial part that could travel to the land of the dead, and this, to my mind, is persuasive evidence against believing in the afterlife. But enough, for the moment, of ancient peoples.\r\rPaul McAuley memorably described Alastair Reynolds' Revelation Space as 'gonzo cybergoth space opera', a phrase that at once made the book an attractive purchase to me. The finale of this novel contains an interesting reversal of standard human thinking on death. Arrogant scientist Dan Sylveste is determined to discover what happened to the alien Amarantin homeworld of Resurgam. Eventually he is led to Hades, apparently a neutron star, which is in fact something more. When the pilot Khouri arrives there also she learns:\r\r'\"You died\" [said Pascale] \"and you were recreated. Your body was reconstructed from the chemical elements already present in the matrix's outer crust, and then you were reanimated, and quickened to consciousness...\"'\r\rAnd we learn from Sylveste himself:\r\r'He told her... how he had passed into the matrix - at which point, his memories diverged from his other self. But when he told her he was sure that his other self was dead, he did so with such conviction that Khouri wondered if there was not another way of knowing...'\r\rIt is as if Resurgam is not the other side, the dark side, but an alternate version of the real side. Being simulated by a computational matrix is a clever take on the myth of the afterlife. There is for Sylveste a life after death, but it is on the same side.\r\rOne of the greatest myths of the dead concerns Dracula the vampire. A modern take on this myth was provided by China Mieville in his epic novel The Scar, in which we meet the Brucolac, more than three hundred years old, his body ruined by light; the leader of the vampir. He is termed Deadman, while he terms others Liveman. But is he undead? Mieville, alas, is too clever to tell us. Lashed cruciform to a mast in one of the novel's most memorable images, the Brucolac is bleached by sunlight and healed by darkness. He is, it seems, one of those most symbolic of human creations, a being of the boundary, in this case of the boundary between day and night: life and death.\r\rBoundary creations abound in human symbolic thought. Cerberus, The Ferryman, Janus of the threshold, the medium, the ghost-hunter. Some of these creations mimic the status of the shaman, that most ancient of boundary dwellers, who has the ability on behalf of his tribe to deal with the entities of the other side. But recently a new theory has been proposed concerning those who inhabit 'liminal' environments (that is, those between two fundamentally different environments). In Timothy Taylor's The Buried Soul it is suggested that the so-called bog-people - remarkable preserved bodies found in bogs in countries such as Denmark, Holland, Germany and in Cheshire in England - are placed and treated because of ancient attitudes to death. Raised bogs are a liminal environment, neither land nor water, often mobile, like great green blisters. In 1771, after a period of heavy rain, Solway Moss expanded and burst, drowning houses beneath twelve metres of watery peat.\r\rIt was into this kind of environment that ancient European peoples placed certain of their number. Often these unlucky men, women and children were killed in multiple ways. Taylor theorises that their fate was to be:\r\r'...taken to a liminal place, vexed beyond belief, and then thrust, body and soul at once, through into another world... this was not the grand world of the dead, but the mysterious, twilight world of the elves... [who] could guarentee exclusion from all that was socially important, living or dead.'\r\rThe bog people were deemed problematic to society. To exclude them not only from the world of the living but also from the world of the dead they were multiply killed, then cast into the liminal world. There they were neither one thing nor the other. And this gives us an important insight into the thinking of ancient people. To them, the world of the dead - the afterlife - was as real as their own world. It was not enough simply to kill a person who brought shame; that wrongdoer had to be cast out of the dark land beyond also. Death was feared. Dead people, who were thought to continue in the afterlife, were also feared.\r\rThough Dracula, the Brucolac et al are not creations of shame, they are nonetheless boundary dwellers, and as such exercise immense power over the human psyche. Individuals of shame were killed using more than one method in the ancient world, and with forensic precision: garotted, stabbed, drowned. Vampires similarly need to be killed in specific ways. This cultural method of dealing with what people fear is a method of social exclusion. It speaks eloquently of our inability to cope with the truth of our own demise.\r\rIn Bruce Sterling's Schismatrix there is another intriguing description of futuristic death. Abelard Lindsey is one man amongst many struggling to survive in the post-Earth chaos of the solar system. Towards the end of his story he discovers that a coma of five years has passed, during which human life has undergone a 'Prigoginic Leap' (named after Ilya Prigogine, systems scientist), which is a new kind of spontaneous self-organisation. And Lindsey's enemy Constantine is dead:\r\r'...so to speak, but it's a question of definition. I have the scans on his condition from his congenetics. The damage is very severe. He fell into a protracted fugue state and suffered an accellerated consciousness that must have lasted for subjective centuries... It lasted so long that his personality was abraded away. Speaking metaphorically, he forgot himself to pieces.'\r\rWhat a marvellous description of death! Sterling, who must rate as one of the great thinkers of speculative fiction, here pushes the boundaries of imaginary demise. He effectively said that Constantine is experiencing time in all its tedious, expansive totality, second by second, without any means of slipping into those states natural to us, who on occasion can while away the hours in sweet daydream.\r\rAs an interesting aside, John Gribbin remarked in his excellent work Deep Simplicity:\r\r'Prigogine showed... that a dissipative system in the linear regime settles down not into the state of death corresponding to maximum entropy (as it would be in equilibrium), but into a state where entropy is being produced as slowly as possible, and the dissipative activity is ticking over at a minimum rate... Things exist in a steady state in the linear regime; a human being, for example, can maintain his or her integrity for many years using the flow of energy (and food) through their body, although in this case the steady state eventually breaks down, for reasons which are still not understood.'\r\rSo in simple breakdown lies Death's sting.\r\rReturning to mythic writing, I want to turn to Neil Gaiman's American Gods. One of the most memorable scenes concerns the terrible ordeal of Shadow, hung, rather like the Brucolac, upon a tree. In this specifically Norse vision of Gaiman's we meet certain symbolic beings whose utterances give us clues; a squirrel, for instance. Later, after the inevitable blackness, Shadow walks through what he supposes is the afterlife. He meets certain gods, including Bast, who remarks:\r\r'\"There's dead, and there's dead, and there's dead. It's a relative thing.\"'\r\rShadow suspects that he is dead. He believes he is inhabiting a land. He meets a man on a low, flat boat: a ferryman. Yet, a little later:\r\r'Mr Jacquel opened the last door for Shadow, and behind that door there was nothing. Not darkness. Not even oblivion. Only nothing.'\r\rAnd this, of course, illustrates the problem human beings have with death. It is a logical impossibility to imagine non-existence. The best we can do is describe a shadow of it, using mere words. Most people, when pressed, will admit that it is not death itself they are frightened of, it is the suffering that all too often precedes death. Yet, it is possible for a premonition of death to be a good thing.\r\rI do not wish to give the impression that \"fantasy\" deals only with illusory re-tellings of human myth, whereas \"science-fiction\" deals with original speculation about the future of humanity. So it is with some pleasure that I mention one of the most remarkable, inspirational and emotionally satisfying speculative descriptions of death. It occurs, of all places, in Tolkien's The Lord Of The Rings, but not in the tale itself. Rather, it lies in one of the appendices, where Aragorn speaks on his deathbed to Arwen Undomiel:\r\r'I am the last of the Numenoreans and the latest King of the Elder Days; and to me has been given not only a span thrice that of Men of Middle-Earth, but also the grace to go at my will, and give back the gift. Now, therefore, I will sleep.'\r\rI have always found these lines deeply moving. Aragorn, aware that he cannot 'wither and fall from my high seat unmanned and witless', is able to surrender life through a voluntary process. In this passage Tolkien, despite his ignoble status as a Christian who believed in God, spirit and the afterlife, managed to articulate both our fear of death and the grace we would aspire to, in just a few sentences. This is a mark of his stature as one of the great storytellers of our time.\r\rIt seems to me that we must also consider the sheer longevity of the idea that every human being has a non-corporeal spirit which survives after bodily death. We have to go back a considerable way to reach the earliest uncontroversial human burials, to a time 70,000 years ago, a period when both homo sapiens and homo neandertalensis were roaming the planet. (There is possible evidence of burials dating to earlier periods.) One of the most interesting ancient burials is that of a Neandertal boy in the Teshik-Tash cave of Uzbekistan. A description of how he was laid to rest can be found in Richard Rudgley's Secrets Of The Stone Age:\r\r'A solitary bone tool, made from a bone of a Siberian mountain goat, lay close to the body of the boy... Five or six pairs of horns of the mountain goat were arranged in an upright position (inclined towards the skull) with their pointed ends down in a roughly circular pattern around the skull and adjacent parts of the skeleton... The pattern of the interlocking pairs of goat horns found next to the skeleton convinced the excavators that they had been consciously placed there as part of a funerary rite.'\r\rFor Neandertal people therefore, almost a hundred thousand years ago, life and death were already distinct states; and it was this notion that allowed them to wonder what happened to individuals after death. But for how many millennia before were such beliefs prevalent?\r\rFast forwarding into the Classical era we can study Homer's Odyssey to find this passage, where Odysseus is spoken to by his mother concerning the afterlife:\r\r'This is no trick played on you by Persephone, Daughter of Zeus. You are only witnessing here the law of our mortal nature, when we come to die. We no longer have sinews keeping the bones and flesh together, but once the life-force has departed from our white bones, all is consumed by the fierce heat of the blazing fire, and the soul slips away like a dream and flutters away on the air.'\r\rAnd finally, in our own era, we can turn to the gripping finale of Robin Hobb's Royal Assassin, in which FitzChivalry, having been captured and tortured, cheats death by spiritually communing with the wolf Nighteyes:\r\r'How does one leave one's body behind? I tried to ignore it, to be aware of myself only as Nighteyes. Keen nose... I tasted snow and my own paw as I nibbled and licked it away... But there was still that thread, that tiny awareness of a stiff and aching body on a cold stone floor. Just to think of it made it more real... Suddenly, it was all too easy. Such an easy choice. Leave that body for this one... No point to being a man at all.'\r\rThough I read this novel well over a decade ago, the memory of the emotional resonance, of the awe of the above passage remains with me to this day. Hobb's great skill with character, in parallel with the power of the torture scenes, meant that I, like any reader, was desperate to know if FitzChivalry would escape being murdered. And he did. But, alas, it was an illusion.\r\rOr is it alas? It is possible to trace the concept of life and death, and the parallel concept of spirit or soul, over tens of thousands of years, from our Neandertal ancestors right up to the present day. 'Life has to be a preparation for some other dimension,' claimed the New Age guru Terence McKenna. But this claim, made by all religions - including the secular religions of the twentieth century - is based on a misunderstanding. I accept that it is an understandable misunderstanding, but it is nonetheless an error, as can be shown by the work of such writers as Alastair Reynolds and Bruce Sterling. For if they can imagine other modes of death, then the traditional, so ordinary, so tired and so obvious mode can also be imaginary.\r\rOf course, I cannot prove any of this. But neither can Terence McKenna or the Pope prove their views. We must decide on balance of likelihood. Ignoring the logical contradictions of arguments in favour of spirit and the afterlife, let us instead ask the simplest, and therefore the best, question. There is no evidence for the existence of ghosts, of vampires, of the particulars of shamanic culture. There is no evidence for the existence of the afterlife. There is no evidence to show that we each carry a spirit within us. No communication claimed by a medium has ever been shown to be real. And the unexplained may not be used as positive evidence: claiming that the 'white light' of near-death-experience is unexplained, for instance, is not positive evidence for an afterlife, nor even an indication of its possibility.\r\rIs it not simpler and more reasonable to think that once our bodies fail our selves do also? Why should we carry on re-inventing the complications of afterlife, of spirit, of that unimaginable threshold? Belief in life after death cheapens life. Though it is a comforting illusion to many, it is nonetheless an illusion. Belief that living is preparation for something else leaches authenticity from life.\r\rMastery of the fear of death is gained by enjoying life to the full. Though I know I will die, I hope that when the time comes I will have done all that I need to do; and if I have, then I will feel no sting. Such hope sustains me, and it can sustain us all. It is a tragedy that so many people substitute religion for effort and illusion for reason.\r\r*******************\r\rWorks Cited\rGaiman, Neil 'American Gods' (2000)\rGribbin, John 'Deep Simplicity' (2004)\rHobb, Robin 'Royal Assassin' (1996)\rHomer, 'The Odyssey' (Penguin Classics edition 1946)\rLe Guin, Ursula K.

I've found alot of similar stuff but somehow I can't make it out like something I would like.\r\rLemme hit you with some interesting points of what kind of books I'm looking for. Since I doubt what I want is in one specific book I'll just lay out some things I would like to see.\r\r1. Scifi-noir. Now I know this has been up before, but the books I looked at didn't seem to fit into that. I don't know of any books like this but I know a movie I like alot; Blade runner. If you have seen The Animatrix you'll also remember \"A Detective Story\". Another movie which comes to mind is also Sin City. I really like that stereotype detective who has drinking problems, it's autumn, rain is pouring down, he's getting beat up by thugs etc. Basically everything is going bad for him and it's a hard world. \rEven if you know some books like this that isn't scifi I would apprechiate that aswell.\r\r2. Scifi-horror. This has also been up here a few times but mostly it just feels old and dated. Monsters are usually things that would scare an audience looking at a black\/white movie with stiff movements and lame fantasy. I'm a guy who enjoys the mystique alot more than zombies or squid-face-man walking around killing people. \rUnder this category I could also mention that isolated places for this category is music to my ears. Spaceships or the south pole etc. If you have seen Sunshine, Alien, Pandorum. It also exists alot in games, Dead space and System shock 2 are two favorites. Now I know I said I prefer the mystique over the monsters, which isn't true if you look at my examples, but there's somehow a feeling of desolation and I quite like that.\r\r3. This is a hard one, because I dunno how to describe it. I would love to read some scifi which, somehow, is about humans and our minds. Not scifi with aliens or virtual reality or AI. Just that we somehow evolved in a boring but realistic way and that we somehow have problems with our goverment, people are getting weird diseases and dying, explorations of the human mind, I dunno. Post-apocalyptical events perhaps?\r\rThis is basically what I'm looking for, if you want to I'd love to keep an open dialoge. I guess it might be pretty hard to find books that match these but just something similiar would be fine aswell.\r\rBest regards!","Year":2010},{"username":"Keyoke","date":1014336000000,"title":"C.S.

For example:* The \"Adamists\" and \"Edenists\" of Hamilton's Night's Dawn series are very similar to the \"Mechanists\" and \"Shapers\" of Bruce Sterling's Schismatrix.* The \"Prime\" from Hamilton's Commonwealth Saga are very similar to the \"Moties\" from The Mote in God's Eye by Niven & Pournelle.* The \"Inhibitors\" of Reynolds' Revelation Space series are very similar to the \"mechs\" of Gregory Benford's Galactic Center series (the \"alpha\" and \"beta\" simulations and the realm of the \"Shrouders\" are also highly reminiscent of elements from the Galactic Center series).* Banks' Culture series contains a lot of elements from Star Wars (\"drones\" = \"droids\") and Star Trek (most of the aliens, most of the technologies).This is not to say these books are copycat trash.

Something like BSG, where there is still a very clear and identifiable link with the Earth as we know it, but with enhancements and major progress made in terms of space warfare and colonization, something that shows you the history of how we came to be at the point we are in the book.\r\rAny thoughts?","Year":2008},{"username":"leo08285","date":1222473600000,"title":"Green Futures Of Tycho Questions [SPOILERS]","replies":2,"views":637,"text":"Hey Everyone,\r\r   I just got finished reading the Green Futures of Tycho and I really enjoyed it.

It's written in an avant-garde style, and I think Kubrick's writers did an excellent job of translating it out of code. The code's the unwritten code of their world.\r\rWhat we see in it is people who have absolutely no explanation for existence who face random dangers and whose only purpose is whatever occurs to them at a given time. There is no coherent existence around them to relate to, possibly through fault of their own...they've all run off from the real world, psychically if no other way.\r\rWhat there would be to existence is represented by vestiges of an existence that had once held sway there, mainly the central figure's family, from whence proceeded remote references to a morality the book may have had.\r\rI wonder if anyone has noticed the similarity of a lot that has been written or made into movies since that book was written to the viewpoint expressed by Burgess?  Samuel Delaney's writings have been similar, as have been those of writers similar to Delaney, for instance Neil Stephenson with SNOW CRASH; and there is the same similarity in existence as seen in DARK ANGEL and other films of that nature.

The books have interesting minimalist covers and are being marketed nicely. The titles are:\r\rAltered Carbon by Richard Morgan\rMorgan's debut novel, a cyberpunk noir ultraviolent thriller starring Takeshi Kovacs. Co-stars a sentient hotel. Brilliant. *****\r\rBlood Music by Greg Bear\rScientist inadvertantly dooms the Earth and the human race to utter annihilation. Or does he? Basically Arthur C. Clarke's Childhood's End rewritten for a later generation (Bear does this a lot). It doesn't stop it being utterly superb. Bear's best novel by light years. *****\r\rRevelation Space by Alastair Reynolds\rThe opening salvo in the very good Revelation Space Trilogy, and the first novel in a wider universe now encompassing five novels and two collections. Chasm City - a standalone in the same universe - is Reynolds' best book and a better candidate for the range, but Revelation Space is still relentlessly readable and entertaining, despite echoes of Fred Saberhagen's Beserker novels coming through towards the end. ****\r\rThe Separation by Christopher Priest\rJaw-droppingly clever. Original. Startling. Difficult to describe, almost impossible to review, with a series of plot twists at the end which may cause the reader's brain to implode, but it all hangs together and makes sense. One of the very best SF&F novels released this century from the author of The Prestige. *****\r\rI haven't read the other books in the range:\r\rEvolution by Stephen Baxter\rFairyland by Paul J.

While I definitely haven't read all of them, I have read plenty, and I am always impressed.  Even if it's not exactly my kind of novel, I can still see why it was chosen and what's great about it.  Many of my favorite SciFi books are Hugo or Nebula winners.\r\rHowever, I just finished Falling Free by Lois McMaster Bujold, and was kind of disappointed.  It seemed a fairly straightforward, simplistic novel.  The characters were very one-dimensional, especially the villian Van Atta.  There's really nothing super original in the plot - it's almost a rehashing of The Moon is a Harsh Mistress.  I found myself wishing it was over at several points.\r\rI really like Bujold, too.  She's one of my favorite authors - Barrayar (another award winner) is an incredible novel, and her other Miles Vorkosigan books are excellent.  But Falling Free left me bored.\r\rHas anyone else read Hugo or Nebula winners that they didn't enjoy?  Which ones and why?\r\r\r<EDIT: December, 2005>\rTwo years after I started this thread, I tallied up everyone's votes and made this post:\r\rOk, I just ran a summary count of the most hated award winners!

Their ship has some sort of venting system to expose the crew to absolute zero for freezing\/travelling purposes and this amazes the whoever it was that intercepted them (memory gets decidedly fuzzy here).Also some mention of various attrocities commited by the Antha and some sort of connection to Julius Caesar's mutilation of Gaulish Prisoners (cutting off right hands or something).Any assistance would be appreciated as this is driving me up the wall!!!

Tiger! (a.k.a. The Stars My Destination) (1956) by Alfred Bester, which I\u2019m sure many posters at sffworld.com have read. For those that haven\u2019t, the novel is set in the 24th Century and by this time human beings have learnt to utilise a previously dormant part of their brains to teleport or \"jaunte\" from point to point; an ability limited by their own personal capacities and the fact that jaunting from a planet to anywhere in outer space remains impossible. Earth is ruled megacorporations as powerful as the governments, and a war between the galaxy\u2019s Inner Planets and Outer Satellites, driven not by politics but by economics, breaks out as jaunting throws the carefully balanced galactic marketplace into havoc. \r\rIt is in this setting that we are introduced to Gulliver (\"Gully\") Foyle as a man of wasted potential, a complete slacker, doing the minimum he can to get by. He is serving as a mechanic on the spaceship Nomad when it is attacked and wrecked, leaving him as the sole-survivor marooned in space with no escape. He lacks the motivation to save himself and for six months survives in an airtight locker no bigger than a large coffin, occasionally making dangerous sojourns into the wrecked spaceship to replenish his air and food supplies. When a ship named Vorga deliberately ignores his distress signals he is spurred to action. This leads Foyle into a conflict with some deliciously insidious villains (one of them \"hot\" from radioactive fallout) and trysts with a cast of beautiful, yet emotionally damaged heroines.\r\rWith elements of dark character study of a vengeance-driven man I\u2019m aware (though I\u2019ve never read the book or seen the film) Tiger! Tiger! is apparently a homage to The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas (actually, I read the plot had its origins in a newspaper clipping that Bester found, of a shipwrecked WW II sailor on a raft, who had drifted unrescued in the Pacific for days because passing ships thought he was a lure to bring them within torpedo range of a hidden submarine).\r\rWith its now familiar tropes of powerful megacorporations, cybernetic augmentation of the body and mind, and the noir, dystopian nature of the future world, Bester's book is considered an ancestor of the cyberpunk movement. At first, I found his writing a little anachronistic, but was soon enjoying his baroque, almost gonzo, style. Despite its clich\u00e9s, I don\u2019t believe this is a book that has been out-dated, a criticism that can perhaps be leveled at much \"classic\" science fiction. The idea of jaunting initially seemed cheesy to me, yet I soon realised that by allowing his characters to travel great distances in the blink of an eye, Bester creates a furious narrative pace which really had me turning the pages. The idea of jaunting also allows him to weave philosophical musings into his adventure story, which leads to a satisfying pay off in the novel's metaphysical climax.\r\rI read that Bester is something of a pop-culture icon, being a writer on Superman in the 1940s and creator of the original Green Lantern. The enthusiasm of those \"funny books\", and I suppose even earlier pulps, infuses Tiger! Tiger!, creating a sense of fun which I found very infectious. Bester also displays a whimsical sense of humour, which is tempered by the dark nature of the story. Gully Foyle is an antihero, driven by his thirst for vengeance, and his amorality might make him a difficult character for some to sympathise with. I had no such difficulties . I enjoyed watching his transformation from a slacker-loser into dangerous, tiger-faced, cybernetically-enhanced hunter!  \r\rThe title is a quotation from one my favourite poems, The Tyger by William Blake.","Year":2004},{"username":"Hobbit","date":1082851200000,"title":"Philip K Dick Award Winner 2004","replies":0,"views":987,"text":"It's that time of year.... \r\rOne I forgot to mention (as it came out at the same time as the bsfa Awards - doh!)  is that the winner of the Philip K Dick Award is....\r\r\rRichard Morgan for his novel Altered Carbon.\r\rHis first award!

The idea of the list(s) would be to give people that are fairly new to the genre or who tend to stick to niche's\/sub-genre's, suggested reading that will expose them to the full spectrum and wealth that SF novels have to offer. But first, a few qualifiers if you want to submit your list:\r\r- This is to be a list of the most seminal, most important, most influential, most genre-shaping and (in their time) boundary pushing novels that should be considered \"must read\" for any SF enthusiast.\r\r- This is not a list of your favourite SF novels, or even necessarily the \"best\". In fact your list (like mine) may contain books you didn't even particularly like. Try to be objective about it (trust me, it can be pretty hard). If you're tempted to add the Dune prequels or a Star Wars novel, you probably shouldn't be submitting a list - as enjoyable as they might be, or as much as you may love them.\r\r- Only include books that you have read. It may sound silly, but it can be tempting to add something because it's generally regarded as \"important\", even though you haven't gotten around to reading it yet. No one is expecting anyone to have read every novel ever published. Hopefully from these lists everyone may find some lost\/forgotten treasures to read.\r\r- Only submit a list if you have read at least around 100 or so SF novels. The aim of the exercise is to share some well rounded knowledge and experience, not just name every SF book you've ever read.\r\r- Entire series' don't count, however books that are technically one book published in several parts do. For example I'd consider the Mars Trilogy (Red\/Green\/Blue Mars) or the Foundation Trilogy (Foundation, Foundaiton and Empire, Second Foundation) one entry, but any of Dune books, or the Ender books would have to be added individually. Obviously there's some personal opinion in qualifiying this and what counts, but hopefully you get the general idea. Also no cheating and trying to include omnibus editions (such as H. G. Wells - Five Great Novels) as one entry!\r\r- I'm going to put a limit for entries by any single author to 5. You may consider this unfair for some of your favourite authors, but personally I found it difficult to include more than 2 entries per author and remain objective. It may not look it, but 50 is a pretty short list. So 5 is the limit.\r\r- Short story collections count. Obviously, however, \"The Complete Short Stories of...\" is taking to too far. We're talking things like I, Robot or The Martian Chronicles. I was originally going to allow anthologies, but I know when compiling my own list, it was hard enough cutting it down to 50 without having to cater for anthologies such as Dangerous Visions (as essential reading as they may be) as well. So no anthologies, only single author collections.\r\r- Lists aren't to be ranked. We don't need to make this any more difficult that it already is. Just submit your lists in order of author surname. \r\r\rIt sounds like a lot of rules, but they're mainly to make your jobs easier and maintain the quality of the lists, not make things hard. If you really don't like a rule(s) or think some more should be added, feel free to comment. \r\rSo take some time and think about your lists, browse through your book collection, maybe even do some research on the web to make sure you haven't overlooked some books you may have read long ago. Hopefully some of you include books that didn't quite make the cut for the my final 50 list because there's a couple of dozen other books I'd have dearly loved to add \r\rSorry about the length of the post, but without further delay and to get the ball rolling - here's my list of 50 \"essential\" SF reads:\r\rFoundation Trilogy (Foundation\/Foundation and Empire\/Second Foundation) - Isaac Asimov\rTimescape - Gregory Benford\rThe Demolished Man - Alfred Bester\rThe Stars My Destination - Alfred Bester\rCities in Flight - James Blish\rFahrenheit 451 - Ray Bradbury\rThe Martian Chronicles - Ray Bradbury\rStartide Rising - David Brin\rStand on Zanzibar - John Brunner\rEnder's Game - Orson Scott Card\rSpeaker for the Dead - Orson Scott Card\rChildhood's End - Arthur C.

I won't identify anyone, however, without first asking you for permission.Gaiman's American Gods and Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale are two obvious and timely choices but I might go for:Neal Stephenson\u2014Snowcrash (though it's not age-appropriate for school kids) In a weird way, I feel this is the heir to Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Fiveand\/orUmberto Eco\u2014Foucault\u2019s Pendulum The premise that, if you say something often enough and make enough people believe it, it'll be true, fits our internet age perfectly.","Year":2018},{"username":"Zillarian","date":1286236800000,"title":"Alternate Military Historical Fiction... SciFi?","replies":1,"views":485,"text":"I've been working on a list of Military Science Fiction works, movies, books, anime, etc... My original thought was to include alternate military historical fiction in this list but have begun to doubt if truly fits in the Military SciFi genre. It's not historical fiction and it's not really Military Scifi. Should it just be in it's own sub-genre of historical fiction? For that matter were does alternate history fiction in general fit in the grand scheme of things.\r\rThoughts and opinions?","Year":2010}]
